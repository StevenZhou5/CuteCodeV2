african national congress opposes sanctions against zimbabwe
xinhua news agency, johannesburg, march 18 (reporter gao yuan) motlanthe, secretary general of african national congress (anc), the ruling party of south africa, criticized here on the 18th the western nations such as the united states and britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force zimbabwe into following the will of the western nations.
in response to the western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against zimbabwe, motlanthe told the press: "who should rule zimbabwe is zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the western nations."
he pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and anc strongly opposes the western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation.
if the western nations impose further sanctions against zimbabwe, motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in zimbabwe.
he called on the government of zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis.
he emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split zimbabwe.
earlier, anc had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time.
mugabe, president of zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from march 9 to march 11. however, the western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom. they therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against zimbabwe.
at present, some western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to zimbabwe.
before the election, eu nations cited zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against zimbabwe.

jordan to come back from his recovery of injury as early as sunday
xinhua news agency, washington, march 19 (reporter xie peiling) "air jordan" is expected to come back as early as sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery. however, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for washington wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this.
the wizards coach collins revealed today that jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up. although he does not yet want to show up in denver and salt lake city on wednesday and thursday, he is very likely to go to toronto to re-don his wizards outfit and challenge the raptors that is currently not in a good shape.
collins said: "he may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels.
currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket.
he plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment.
as far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery."
jordan has averaged a score of 24.3 during this season. he underwent the surgery three weeks ago. in the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8.
at present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season. the wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the nba eastern conference. it lagged half a game behind the miami heat, one game in advance of the raptors, but is still two and half games away from charlotte hornets that ranked 8th.
naturally, coach collins in particular hopes jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games.
collins said: "if jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time.
judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team."

the topics of the conversation covered the world economy and the shortcomings of "windows" operation system, and bill gates was also invited to visit quebec at an appropriate time.

karzai said on the 5th that turkey's concern over its troops' potential involvement in renewed unrest in other areas of afghanistan is redundant.

foreign ministry spokeswoman comments on report adopted by european parliament
xinhua news agency, beijing, april 19 while answering reporters' questions here today, foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue commented on the report adopted by the european parliament.
a reporter asked: on april 11, the plenary session of the european parliament reviewed and adopted "european parliament's report on an eu strategy towards china."
how does china comment on this?
zhang qiyue answered: china has noticed that the european parliament has recently adopted this report.
the report holds that a broad range of common interests exists between china and europe. it advocates development of the partnership between china and europe, increase in bilateral contacts, exchanges and dialogs, and expansion of the cooperation between both sides in such fields as economics, trade, science and technology, education and culture.
we welcome all the above positive propositions.
however, the report has made many wrong conclusions that do not conform to objective facts on such issues as human rights situation in china, and the issues of taiwan and tibet. these seriously interfere with china's internal affairs and are unacceptable to the chinese side.
we hope the european parliament will truly abide by the one-china principle and do more things that will benefit the development of the bilateral relations so as not to cause any negative impact on the relationship between china and europe.

however, he suddenly softened his attitude yesterday and indicated the prayers will be changed to another location in ayodhya.
according to the local media, paramhans, currently 93, has changed his original plan under the pressure of the ruling indian people's party.

serious sandstorm hit beijing again
(beijing, afp) the state media of china said that yesterday a serious sandstorm hit beijing again.

what we can do is to control the human factors that cause sandstorms and prevent desertification of the environment."

the chinese government pledged to pour in 56.8 billion yuan (12.376 billion singapore dollars) from 2002 to 2008 to curb desertification and reduce the formation of sandstorms.
beijing alone will spend about 1 billion yuan (about 220 million singapore dollars) this year.

the new yorker weekly: iraqi intelligence agency in close contact with al qaeda for years
(washington, syndicated news) the most recent issue of the new yorker weekly reports that for years the iraqi intelligence agency has been in close contact with al qaeda network led by osama who masterminded the september 11 attacks.
it is reported that these two organizations jointly command a terrorist organization in the kurdish area of northern iraq.
the cia has always been skeptical about the claim that iraqi president hussein has been in touch with al qaeda network.
the "hawks" in the bush administration who support military actions against iraq have been trying in the past to find evidence of hussein's ties with al qaeda network.
the day before yesterday, these officials praised highly the report by the new yorker weekly, saying the report is the latest evidence that supports their argument.
the report said that there is an ansar muslim guerrilla made up of kurds and arabs in the kurdish area of iraq. the members of this guerrilla have all received training in osama's camps.
the article's author goldberg said that he interviewed several ansar muslim guerrilla's special agents captured by a pro-american kurdish group, "the patriotic union of kurdistan." these special agents claimed that ansar muslim guerrilla is under the joint command of hussein and al qaeda network and that some al qaeda fighters in afghanistan have already fled to the kurdish area of iraq controlled by ansar muslim guerrilla.
the special agents added that iraq once hosted an al qaeda leader of egyptian origin in baghdad in 1992.
the us officials warned that the patriotic union of kurdistan may make full use of this report to prove that the us plan to overthrow hussein regime is justifiable.
newspapers in gulf countries report: cheney's middle east trip is a failure
(dubai, syndicated news) newspapers in gulf countries said on monday that the us vice president cheney's trip to the middle east is a failure.
cheney's trip is to lobby the middle east nations to support the united states in its attack against iraq.
cheney arrived in kuwait on monday after he visited all the gulf nations, but even this most loyal ally of the us also objects to attacking baghdad.
the saudi arabian newspaper "motherland" said: "what this vice president has heard is : the united states must stop the israeli terrorism and prevent israel from possessing weapons of mass destruction."
the newspaper also pointed out: "if the united states continues to ignore the interests of the middle east nations, it will lose its interests in the gulf region."
the united arab emirates newspaper gulf news also said: "this is a new failure of the united states in the middle east after it ran into snags in europe.
most of the us allies in europe publicly object to invading iraq."
yesterday in manama, the capital of bahrain, cheney denied the mission of his middle east trip was to organize a military assault on iraq.
he said at a joint press conference held with crown prince salman that some people think his only interest during this trip is to organize a military assault on iraq, but he denies that.
cheney claimed that he and crown prince salman mainly talked about the latest development in the war against terrorism, the situation in the middle east and afghanistan.
cheney arrived in israel on monday evening for a visit. he is expected to meet with prime minister sharon and discuss the latest development in the israeli-palestinian conflict.
on the other hand, the commanders-in-chief of israel and palestine in the west bank and the gaza strip surprisingly held a talk yesterday aiming to end the violence in this region.
this talk may be the first step israel has made in withdrawing its troops from the palestinian controlled territories.
the palestinian side said that if the israeli troops do not withdraw from these areas, palestine will not participate in any peace negotiations brokered by the united states.
street crimes rose sharply, britain to increase police patrol
(london, ap) the british government will be committed to solving the ever-increasing street crimes and will increase police patrol.
home secretary blunkett said that in order to curb the rising street muggings and violence, it is essential to increase police patrol.
he said, "we really should keep order in the street, because the law-abiding citizens hope to walk safely in the street, live a peaceful life and have no fear of being attacked."
although the overall crime rate in britain has dropped, the street crimes increased 13% from 2000 to 2001.
the situation in london is even more alarming. from september to november of 2001 alone, the reported cases of robbery amounted to 19,248, more than double the figure of 8,614 in the same period the year before.
the government also said the rise of crime cases was mainly due to the large increase of mobile phone robberies. last year, there were more than 700,000 cases of mobile phone robbery in the country.
this is the first time that the british police have focused their forces on the street hooliganism and robbery, while the previous focus was mainly on cracking down on the illegal possession of firearms and drug dealing in the street.
this new plan will first be implemented in the ten neighborhoods where street crimes are more concentrated.
the police will increase patrols in these neighborhoods and provide more protection to the victims.
workers in 10 state-owned factories in liaoning staged mass demonstration
(beijing, afp) workers in 10 state-owned factories in liaoyang, liaoning province in northeastern china staged a mass demonstration yesterday in protest of the overdue wages and pensions, low severance packages and embezzlement.

according to a relative of yao who spoke on condition of anonymity: "he never returned from shopping. several people saw him taken away."
in addition, in daqing oilfield in the neighboring province of heilongjiang, the police and daqing petroleum administration bureau told the reporter that the sit-in demonstration by the laid-off oil workers has entered the third week, though the number of the workers participating in the sit-in has decreased from the initial 50,000 to just over 1,000.
some sources said that the workers in these two cities have established an independent labor union and decided to elect some representatives for negotiations.
under the existing law, this action is not permitted.
han dongfang, executive of a hong kong-based organization of chinese labor movement, said that although the two demonstrations started right after the national people's congress ended its session, the problem has been there for quite a long time.
han went on to say, a demonstration also took place in a textile factory on monday in guangyuan, sichuan. it was triggered by the arrest of several labor leaders who organized weekend strikes. as a result, 1,000 workers staged a demonstration in protest.
aviation safety council of taiwan (asc) repeatedly delayed investigation report on singapore airlines crash, causing prosecutors to smell a rat
(taipei) a year and half have passed since the plane crash of the singapore airlines, yet aviation safety council of taiwan (asc) has delayed the investigation report on the plane crash again and again, stalling the investigation by taoyuan district prosecutor's office and causing the prosecutors to smell a rat. as for asc, it has promised to deliver the investigation report in april.
at 11:18 p.m. on october 31, 2000, the singapore airlines flight sq-006 at chiang kai-shek airport bound for los angeles entered by error the runway #05 on the right side during take-off and crashed into the two digging machines and exploded, killing 83 passengers and injuring nearly a hundred passengers.
china times reported yesterday that taoyuan district prosecutor's office in charge of prosecuting for criminal liability after the plane crash has had several disputes over the right to investigate with asc investigation unit.
since the plane crash, wang tiensheng, former chief prosecutor of taoyuan prosecutor's office, has been promoted to chief prosecutor of taichong. chen shouhuang serves as his replacement. the case prosecutor huang moushin has also been transferred to taipei prosecutor's office, handing over the case to chiang yuanchen.
meanwhile, the original due date of the investigation report at the end of last year promised by asc was postponed to the end of january. after the end of january, it was again changed to february. so far there has been no news. urged by the prosecutors, asc now promises to deliver the report in april.
as los angeles was the destination of flight sq-006, some of the victims' families have already taken the case to the us court for huge sums of civil compensation, suing not only singapore airlines but also taiwan civil aviation administration.
the lawsuit by the victims' families for compensation is tantamount to accusing taiwan aviation administration's control tower of negligence of duty. therefore, the result of the investigation by taoyuan prosecutor's office will draw all the more attention.
if arafat abides by us cease-fire agreement, cheney will hold bilateral talks
(jerusalem, syndicated news) israeli prime minister sharon said yesterday that if the palestinian leader arafat implements the cease-fire agreement proposed by the united states, israel will allow arafat to leave the palestinian territories.

by then, israel must make a decision."
the egyptian foreign minister maher indicated the day before yesterday that even if israel does not allow arafat to attend the arab league summit, saudi arabia will still propose a peace motion to solve the violent conflict in the middle east during the summit meeting.

on the other hand, the un secretary general annan sent a letter to sharon the day before yesterday, condemning israel for disregarding the safety of civilians in its escalating military actions and pointing out that the fighting "has come to resemble an conventional warfare with no restraint at all."
annan said that israel used f-16 fighter-bombers, helicopters, naval gunships and missiles to engage in cluster bombings "causing hundreds of innocent civilians including women and children to be injured or killed, and many buildings and homes to be damaged or destroyed."
annan called on sharon to ensure that israeli security forces "use weapons and fighting methods that will cause minimum threat to the safety and property of the palestinian civilians."
another warning for global warming, antarctic ice shelf collapsed
(auckland, syndicated news) the experts at the us national snow and ice data center said yesterday that an antarctic ice shelf has completely collapsed and broken up into thousands of icebergs. this is the largest single event of its kind over the last 30 years and therefore sends another warning about the global warming.
it is reported that the larsen b ice shelf of 3,250 square kilometers on the eastern side of the antarctic peninsula has completely disintegrated in a 35-day period.
the center warned that with the advent of the hot summer season, the other ice shelves are also on the verge of disintegration.
this portends an increase in the rate of flow of glaciers in antarctica, a rise in the global sea level and a threat to the lowland regions.
the center at the university of colorado says at its web site (nsida.org) that the larsen b ice shelf that may have existed for 12,000 years and weighs 720 billion tons started to break up since january 31 of this year, and the ice fragments have formed thousands of drifting icebergs in the weddell sea.

but chretien seems to have changed his original position after he went to hold talks with bush in washington d.c. last thursday.
he told cbs that he will seriously consider any us request for military assistance in areas outside afghanistan.
he said: "in terms of military involvement, if such a situation (as in afghanistan) occurs in other areas, we will study the current situation just as we did when we participated in afghan actions."

"strip alert" means that planes are kept in readiness for emergent take-off at any time.
she also said that the alert will be adjusted at any time according to the level of threat.

when a smallpox-infected terrorist enters into an airport, frist said at the hearing, he can spread the virus to ten innocent passengers through coughing, sneezing or even merely breathing. these ten passengers can in turn spread the virus all over the nation, causing thousands or even millions of deaths through the disease.
he said this is one of the possible forms of weapons of mass destruction.
it does not have to be launched by a missile, nor will it attract the attention like anthrax.
those infected victims and the defense personnel in charge of preventing this kind of weapon may never even know where these viruses (bacteria) come from.
experts told senate foreign relations committee: that is the part of the reason why biochemical weapons are so dangerous.
biden, chairman of senate foreign relations committee, said that preventing biochemical attacks is "an extremely urgent issue that must be taken care of."
senator helms, the committee's most senior republican, said that in order to prevent enemy missiles carrying any kind of warhead from attacking the united states, the united states still needs to build up its missile defense system.
hundreds of thousands of us and south korean soldiers to launch large-scale military exercise
(seoul, afp) on thursday, hundreds of thousands of us and south korean soldiers will launch a largest military exercise in history which will simulate a conflict with north korea. pyongyang angrily labeled it as a provocation of war.
the us officers said on the eve of the week-long military exercise that the drill is purely defensive in nature, but it just takes place after south korean authorities warned that the danger of north korea is not to be ignored.
this is the largest-scale military exercise since the 1950-53 korean war. as no formal agreement has been signed to end the conflict in the korean peninsular, the place has become the last front of the cold war in the world. about 2 million soldiers are facing each other across the border.
the us-south korean combined forces command (cfc) in seoul said that the military exercise from march 21 to march 27 will be testing for the first time the effectiveness of combining two different joint military exercises.
this means hundreds of thousands of soldiers will participate, but the military did not reveal any details.
the cfc spokesman said this exercise will mobilize almost every us and south korean military unit in the korean peninsular and the us military from the outside.
37,000 american soldiers are permanently stationed in south korea to prevent 1.1 million north korean soldiers from attacking the south.
south korea also has 650,000 soldiers.
the cfc named this exercise rs0i/fe02, a combination of computerized military exercise with the annual "foal eagle" exercise.
in the past few years, 500,000 south korean soldiers and 30,000 us soldiers were mobilized for rs0i exercise alone (including 20,000 us soldiers from the outside).
north korea accused the united states of launching the military exercise with an intention to provoke the war.
the official newspaper rodong sinmun even called the us-south korean joint military exercise a "declaration of war."
chinese media praises strategic missile corps
(beijing, afp) among the disputes over the us "nuclear posture review" that lists china as a target for potential nuclear attacks, china's government media praised its own strategic missile corps yesterday.
"pla daily," "people's daily" and other government newspapers all carried at the front page "forging a shield of peace for the republic" in high praises of china's second artillery corps that includes strategic missile and nuclear weapon units.
the article describes that this force uses "a strategic missile training simulation system" that simulates a nuclear attack from a hostile nation and the retaliation by the "red force", or china.
the "red force" uses modern procedures to rapidly design a war plan and deploy new types of mobile missile launchers to remote mountains and forests.
the article filled with technical jargons describes how the second artillery corps uses novel anti-jamming and anti-reconnaissance technologies to display their magic prowess.
the article goes on to say that one missile after another "rises into the sky from remote mountains and accurately hits its target," making the counter-attack a success.
with an estimated strength of 100,000 troopers, the second artillery corps is china's core unit in its effort to enhance the military capabilities and technologies.
this article that summarizes the growth of china's missile and nuclear weapon units from the late 1950s to the present is published at a time of renewed tensions between china and the united states.
china steps up security in embassy district to prevent north koreans from "storming embassies" again
(hong kong) the chinese police recently conducted an internal review over the incident that 25 north koreans stormed the spanish embassy last week.
it is estimated that in beijing alone, more than 150 north koreans are waiting for their chances to go to south korea. the authorities have stepped up security on major embassies such as those of south korea, japan and western nations in the embassy district so as to prevent "storming" incidents from happening again.
singtao reported yesterday that public security sources indicated that since 25 north koreans stormed the spanish embassy by surprise on march 14, beijing police, in addition to the increased security it has provided to those embassies of sensitive nations, has further stepped up protection for the embassies of non-sensitive nations while maintaining a closer contact with the officials of north korean and south korean embassies in beijing.
the sources pointed out, staff from the south korean embassy indicated to the chinese officials that south korea does not encourage north koreans to go to south korea through this means and south korea does not hope to see similar incidents again so that the relations between china and the korean peninsula are not affected. south korea also promises china that it will assist china in managing the south korean residents in beijing.
it is disclosed that about 10,000 ethnic koreans live in the eastern district of beijing and liangmahe in chaoyang district. among them are ethnic koreans from northeast china and those from north and south koreas. they are mainly engaged in korean style restaurant and bar businesses. since they belong to the same korean ethnic group, they get along quite well with each other no matter where they come from.
in the past, the authorities did not consider the ethnic koreans as the focus of their supervision because they were not big in number in beijing, nor did they get involved in so many criminal offenses like those people from xinjiang and henan.
it is reported that after the march 14 incident, the public security agency first "invited" the german doctor who assisted those 25 north koreans for a "talk" at the public security agency and then escorted him to the airport for immediate departure from china.
afterwards, the public security agency and the national security agency started an internal review.
the review mainly consists of two parts: the security protection of the embassy district and the management of the ethnic koreans in beijing.
in addition, the authorities also required the relevant agencies in regions such as jilin to take effective measures to prevent north koreans who have illegally crossed the border from entering beijing.
yellow sanddust eclipsing sun over korean peninsula, dust covers skies over pyongyang and seoul
(syndicated news from pyongyang and seoul) the sandstorm that just swept across northern china hit the korean peninsula violently yesterday. most of the regions, including pyongyang, capital of north korea and seoul, capital of south korea, were enveloped in a brownish dusty haze.
according to xinhua news agency, a strong sandstorm hit pyongyang early yesterday morning.
from early in the morning, the entire city of pyongyang was enveloped in a yellow dust.
this is the first sandstorm to hit north korea since this spring.
six airlines suspended flights
it is also reported by peopleweb in beijing that large areas in south korea were hit by "sandstorms" yesterday. except inchon international airport, flights of six domestic airlines were suspended.
"sandstorms" occurred in south korea nation-wide.
according to the tests by the south korean ministry of environment, the content of fine dust in the air in seoul before yesterday's noon already exceeded the average by 17 times, hitting 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter, the highest record in history.
affected by the dusty weather nation-wide, except inchon international airport that still keeps its normal operation, six domestic airlines routes such as daqiu, weishan, puxiang in south korea were suspended. passengers of more than 30 flights changed their means of transportation.
it is also reported by ap that due to the high concentration of dust in air, the south korean government yesterday ordered all the kindergartens and elementary schools in the country to close temporarily for a day so that children will not be affected by the air pollution.
dusty weather has so far occurred three times in seoul, south korea this year.
the south korea meteorological administration forecast yesterday: "large quantities of dust lifted up by a strong uprising current of air occurring in the desert areas of china and mongolia permeate the air over northern china and will travel with the northwesterly wind to pass through south korea."
asteroid powerful enough to destroy mid-size city brushed by earth
(florida, melbourne, ap) an asteroid large enough to destroy a mid-size city brushed the earth within a short distance of 463,000 km without being detected in advance. astronomers did not know the event until four days later.
about 50 meters in diameter, the asteroid came from the direction of the sun, making it very difficult for astronomers to discover it.
the asteroid brushed by the earth on march 8, but by the time it was discovered on march 12, the asteroid had gone far away.
williams from the international astronomical union's minor planet center located in cambridge, massachusetts had helped locate the position of the asteroid.
from the astronomical perspective, this asteroid is very close to the earth, because the moon is 402,000 km away from the earth.
williams told "florida today" on wednesday: "it is of critical importance the asteroid should have been detected before it came from the direction of the sun."
in this way, astronomers will be able to verify the orbit of the asteroid as soon as possible and predict whether it will bump into the earth.
in 1908 when an asteroid about the same size hit the earth, it caused a pit as wide as 32 kilometers in the forests of siberia.
interior minister confirms senior italian government advisor shot by "red brigade"
(rome, afp) italian interior minister scajola confirmed the day before yesterday that the senior italian government advisor biagi was shot to death by a branch unit of the extremist left-wing guerrilla "red brigade."
scajola said, the two men who killed biagi even used the same pistol that was used to carry out a similar political assassination three years ago.
on the other hand, after biagi's assassination, the italian prime minister berlusconi offered to invite the labor union leaders back to the negotiation table and to discuss the employment reform plan he proposed.
biagi, the 52-year-old advisor for the ministry of labor, was also an economist and law professor.
he was killed by a gunman on a motorcycle when he was riding his bike back to his home in the northern city of bologna. the shooting shocked the italian political circle.
biagi had assisted in drafting an employment reform plan that was strongly opposed by the labor union and the leftists.
they believed the plan would make it easier for employers to fire workers.
eyewitnesses said that biagi was lying in a pool of blood alongside his briefcase.
the door of biagi's home was also found to be carved with a red brigade symbol of five stars, but at this time it is not clear when the symbol was carved.
established in 1973, red brigade was suspected in many bombings and assassinations in italy during the 70s and 80s, including the abduction and murder of the former prime minister moro in 1978.
chinese american engineer sentenced to 5-year imprisonment for illegally obtaining china's state secrets and bribery
(beijing, ap) beijing no.1 intermediate people's court yesterday sentenced the chinese american engineer fang fuming to 5 years in prison on charges of illegally obtaining state secrets and bribing on behalf of a company.
the case had aroused protests from the united states.
the spokesman for the us embassy in china said that fang fuming will be deported from china after he serves his time.
the time of his sentence will be adjusted according to the time he has already served.
the us embassy had sent a diplomat to attend the hearing.
the attorney representing fang fuming said that his client has already been imprisoned for two years, but china said it was not that long.
xinhua news agency confirmed the ruling.
it said, from 1995 to 1999, fang fuming obtained 35 documents containing state secrets and gave 245,000 us dollars (about 450,000 singapore dollars in current value) in bribes to state workers to assist foreign investors bidding for china's power construction projects.
fang fuming was an electrical engineering consultant for a foreign company in its china and other asian offices.
cohen, the attorney representing fang fuming, said that fang fuming denied giving bribes and said he was a victim to the embezzling chinese officials in the power industry.
once a chinese official in the power industry, fang fuming became a us citizen in 1994.
in the past two years, a number of us citizens and residents were accused of violating the chinese national security laws. fang fuming was one of them.
the arrest of fang fuming had temporarily caused tensions between china and the united states.
the us government repeatedly protested against the way china handled the case of fang fuming, accusing the chinese authorities of violating the international norms by detaining fang fuming for several months without any trial.
the family members of fang fuming said he was badly treated.
his wife and two children are all us citizens.
cohen said, fang fuming was detained on february 28, 2000, but the date of custody set by the chinese foreign ministry is august 28, 2000.
china called off naval fleet's visit to the us, declined to confirm whether hu jintao will visit us as planned
(beijing, syndicated news) the sino-us relation that was heated momentarily by the us president bush's visit to china is cooling down rapidly. china confirmed yesterday that it has called off its naval fleet visit to the us ports this year and refused to confirm whether the country's vice president hu jintao will visit the united states as planned.
the foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said while answering reporters' questions at a routine press conference: "as far as i know, china's naval fleet is preparing for a visit as planned; its itinerary does not include the us ports."
when a reporter asked her twice whether hu jintao's plan to visit the united states is affected and whether she can clarify that an earlier answer can be interpreted as an indication that hu jintao will visit the us in april as scheduled, zhang qiyue would not make any further comments nor would she confirm anything.
zhang qiyue only repeatedly accused the us of "doing a series of things that violate the three joint communiques between china and the us" within a short period of one month after president bush's visit to china and demanded that the us "stop using the issue of taiwan to interfere in china's internal affairs."
on the other hand, in washington d.c., the us ignored on wednesday china's warning that a "chilly wind" is blowing over the sino-us relations and insisted that there is nothing wrong with the us permission of taiwan's defense minister to attend "us-taiwan defense summit" held in florida.
beijing repeatedly attacked the us for issuing a visa to taiwan's defense minister tang yiau-ming earlier this month and allowing him to attend a conference sponsored by the us arms manufacturers.
tang yiau-ming also met with two senior us officials at the time.
at a routine press conference, state department spokesman boucher was hounded by reporters asking about china's complaints over this issue, but obviously he was trying his best to avoid a battle of words with china.
he said: "after this meeting, our position is well-known to all.
if you want to ask me about this every day, i am willing to explain it every day. if china wants to ask about this every day, we are willing to explain it every day."
he said: "the position hasn't changed. these are our normal contacts with the taiwanese. we will continue to do so."
zhang qiyue also confirmed yesterday the russian media's report, saying that the chinese president jiang zemin called the russian president putin by phone at his request the night before, and both sides exchanged their opinions on cooperations between china and russia based on mutual benefits.
both sides believe it is in the interest of both nations and peoples to develop mutually beneficial cooperations between china and russia.
Scientists Complete Sequencing of the Chromosome Linked to Early Dementia
(AFP, Paris, January 2)  An international team of scientists said that they have completed the sequencing of human Chromosome 14 that is linked to many diseases, including the early-onset Alzheimer's that may strike people in their 30s.
This is the fourth chromosome whose sequence has been completed to date.  It comprises more than 87 million pairs of DNA.
This study published in the weekly British scientific journal Nature illustrates that the sequence of Chromosome 14 comprises 1,050 genes and gene fragments.
The goal of geneticists is to provide diagnostic tools to identify defective genes that cause diseases so as to arrive eventually at treatments that can prevent those genes from malfunctioning.
The international scientists led by Genoscope, a French gene research center, said that Chromosome 14 contains two clusters of genes that are linked to the function of our immune system and more than 60 disease genes.
Chromosome 14 has been identified in earlier studies on a great number of diseases such as spastic paraplegia that afflicts young children, missing teeth, several forms of vision and hearing impairments and early-onset Alzheimer's.
About 200,000 Americans suffer from early-onset Alzheimer's, accounting for 5% of Alzheimer's patients in the entire United States.
Humans have a total of 23 pairs of chromosomes.
In the past three years, the sequencing of three chromosomes has been completed, including Chromosomes 20, 21, and 22.
Australia Reopens Embassy in Manila
(AFP, Manila, January 2)  Australia reopened its embassy in the Philippines today, which was shut down about seven weeks ago due to what was described as a specific threat of a terrorist attack.
The Philippine Foreign Department said in a statement that Pearce, Australian ambassador to Manila, has telephoned the Philippine Foreign Secretary Ople to announce the resumption of full operations of the embassy.
Like Australia, Canada and the European Union closed their embassies on November 28 and reopened them earlier this week.
Ople said that all three ambassadors are satisfied with the heightened security measures the Philippine government has taken.
The closure of the embassies had angered the Philippine government, which said the alleged threat was exaggerated and the closure of the embassies harmed the image of the Philippines.
Manila fired the police intelligence official because he leaked the unverified intelligence about terrorist threats upon the Australian and Canadian embassies.
The EU office and the Australian embassy are housed in the same building.
Around the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, Western diplomatic missions across Southeast Asia shut down one after another because they received threats linked to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network and its regional allies.
Australian Foreign Minister Says North Korea's Bad Behaviors Will not Gain More Aid
(AFP, Sydney, January 2)  Australia has called on the international community to work together to convince North Korea that holding Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in contempt or other "bad behaviors" will not gain it more aid or other concessions.
Australian Foreign Minister Downer noted today that Pyongyang's decisions to reactivate a controversial nuclear facility and to expel UN monitors are obviously aimed at forcing the international community into making aid and trade concessions.
Australia is one of the few countries that have diplomatic relations with North Korea.
Downer said: "We think what North Korea wants to do is to gain concessions, aid and trade, etc. from the rest of the world, including the United States, by violating the agreed framework signed in 1994."
In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Cooperation, Downer said: "One point we'd like to make to North Korea and a very important one at that, is that bad behaviors will not be rewarded."
Downer pointed out: "Such behaviors as expelling UN monitors and reactivating the nuclear facility at Yongbyon are going to prevent the international community from providing support."
"It's going to produce the reverse effect.  We hope these diplomatic measures will be effective."
"On the other hand, if we overreact, we will fall for North Korea's trick.
We don't want to do that."
Downer indicated that Australia is working closely with the United States and other major allies to pressure North Korea to cancel its recent steps to reactivate the frozen nuclear program.
Downer said: "What we want to do is to ensure that the international community make concerted efforts.  We don't want to take any uncoordinated special countermeasures."
Bush Defends his Economic Stimulus Package
(AFP, Washington, January 6)  US President Bush vowed that the economic stimulus package he is going to unveil will benefit the "working people," and not just the wealthy.  It is generally believed that the wealthy can expect to benefit the most from this plan that urges dramatic tax cuts.
Bush told reporters who are expecting him to officially announce this package in Chicago: "Tomorrow, all of you will hear me saying: the US economy is one of the strongest in the world.
However, we believe the US economy can be even stronger than it is now."
Bush is expected to unveil an economic stimulus package that carries a 10-year price tag of 600 billion US dollars, half of which will be used towards eliminating taxes on dividends paid to shareholders.  He will also call for accelerating the tax rate cuts approved by the US Congress in 2001.
Whether the package can be smoothly promoted is viewed as the front battle of the 2004 US presidential election.  The Democrats attacked Bush's blueprint as an additional bonus to the wealthy, unlike the Democratic proposal which is intended as an aid to the most needy.
The eight-point proposal put forward by the Democrats centers around an incentive measure of 136 billion US dollars to stimulate consumer spending which will cost 100 billion US dollars over a period of ten years.
House Democratic leader Pelosi said at a joint press conference with other opposition lawmakers: "This is a fair, fast-acting, and fiscally sound plan."
Bush led the White House in refuting the accusation from the media that his package only benefits the wealthy, claiming that the economic stimulus package he is going to unveil is chiefly targeted at "revving up economic vitality and growth."
Bush said: "This package will provide tax relief to the working people.
The idea behind the package is that when people have extra money, they are likely to spend it, which can create more jobs."
US Willing to Negotiate with North Korea but Not to Pay More Compensation
(AFP, Washington, January 7)  The United States expressed today its willingness to negotiate with North Korea, a hostile nation on the "axis of evil," but will not provide any fresh inducements to this financially struggling communist nation so as to make it abandon its nuclear program.
US President Bush's administration is currently facing a double crisis with Iraq and North Korea.  The Bush administration officials issued a statement after their talks with senior Japanese and South Korean diplomats, saying that this signals "a step forward" in the US policy toward Pyongyang.
The statement said: "The US delegation is willing to talk with North Korea about how it should meet its obligation to the international community.
However, the US delegation emphasized that the United States will not provide any compensation for North Korea to live up to its existing obligation."
The US officials insisted with carefully worded diplomatic rhetoric that although they are willing to negotiate with North Korea, they will not consider any negotiation procedures before North Korea abides by various agreements on banning nuclear weapons.
The State Department spokesman Boucher said: "We are not willing to pay again for the agreements that have been reached already."
Before that, the Bush administration indicated that the United States will refuse to have talks with North Korea before this Stalinist nation abandons its nuclear program based on enriched uranium and plutonium.
Former Executive of a US Online Real Estate Company to Plead Guilty to Fraud Charges
(AFP, Los Angeles)  Prosecutors said that a former chief executive of "Homestore," a US online real estate company, has agreed to plead guilty to fraud charges and reached a settlement over the lawsuit that originated from the insider trading scandal.
Special Assistant US Attorney Wilner said that Kalina, Homestore's former senior manager of mergers and acquisitions, has entered a plea bargain deal and agreed to plead guilty to one count of securities fraud involving insider trading.
Fuchs, another prosecutor, said that Kalina also agreed to pay 70,000 US dollars to settle a civil lawsuit against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Wilner said that the maximum sentence for securities fraud can be ten years of imprisonment.  However, according to the plea bargain deal, the aforementioned term is expected to be "dramatically shortened."
The prosecutors and investigators pointed out, in the financial fraud scheme in which Kalina was involved, Homestore's chief executives misled investors by overstating the 2001 revenues.
Fuchs said, when Kalina became aware of the artificially inflated stock price, he dumped his Homestore shares to make a profit.  "The Wall Street wasn't aware that the key portion of Homestore's revenues was bogus."
Desimone, Homestore's former vice president who has been charged with similar insider trading, has pleaded guilty.  The court is scheduled to announce sentencing on April 21.
Homestore's Chief Operating Officer Giesecke and former Chief Financial Officer Joseph Shew have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud.
Prosecutors said that Giesecke and Joseph Shew, together with other company chief executives, have been charged with overstating revenues by falsifying Homestore's accounting.
Days of Heavy Snow in Europe Left Many Dead and Transportation Disrupted
(AFP, Vienna, January 8)  Days of heavy snow, low temperatures from Siberia as well as high winds across Europe have caused many deaths while disrupting road, rail, air and sea traffic.
The temperatures in Moscow, capital of Russia, dropped to such low levels last night that even locals felt freezing cold.  Six people died as a result, bringing up the death toll due to coldness this year to 239.  Most of the dead were the homeless and the elderly, including many who were drunk.
Three people died last night in Lithuania, and many others had to have their legs and fingers amputated due to frost bites.
The temperatures in Varena region in the south of the country plummeted to a new low of minus 32.6 degrees Celsius in 16 years.
In Slovakia, three illegal immigrants from India also died of cold and exhaustion on Monday when the local temperatures dropped to minus 20 degrees Celsius.
In the meantime, civil defense services across the European continent and beyond all indicated that snowfalls have blocked roads, delayed trains and paralyzed airports.
Frozen railroad points and road accidents in Britain have paralyzed transportation in some areas.  Heavy snow, after covering the eastern region, is now moving westward.
In the Czech Republic, which was ravaged by serious floods last summer, the temperatures in its border region adjacent to neighboring Slovakia plunged to minus 18 degrees Celsius.
Worldwatch Institute Praises Environmental Revolution
(AFP, Washington, January 9)  In its annual report "State of the World," Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research organization, praised with unusual optimism the advent of "environmental revolution," pointing out that many countries are successfully curbing or solving environmental, health and social problems.
Flavin, head of Worldwatch Institute, said on the 9th: "Building a world that not only meets our needs but also allows future generations to enjoy a healthy society is no longer a day dream."
This edition of State of the World report points out that one of the encouraging achievements is the increasing use of renewable energies such as "solar energy and wind power" in Germany, Japan and Spain.
Speaking about the success of promoting the strategy of renewable energies, Flavin said: "We're entering a new era."
The above-mentioned report says that in the 1990s, the worldwide production of chlorofluorocarbons, "the No. 1 culprit in destroying the ozone layer," has decreased by 81%.
In addition, the anti-polio campaigns promoted by the World Health Organization have reduced polio cases globally from 350,000 in 1988 to 480 in 2001.
This Washington-based environmental research organization also praised local successes in environmental protection.  For example, the Netherlands has achieved an 86 percent recycling rate for automobiles; Denmark has totally banned the use of aluminum cans in favor of recyclable glass bottles; and Brazil has been using renewable energies since 2001.
The organization's report says that the past achievements have brought hopes for relieving serious global threats, which include malaria that claims 7,000 lives every day, and the food, air, and water pollution that leads to the untimely deaths of 5,500 children every day.
AOL Time Warner Chairman Case to Resign in May
(AFP, Washington, January 12)  AOL Time Warner Chairman Case announced tonight that he will resign in May, saying that this move is "the best for the company."
While explaining his decision, Case said that he has decided on the steps to take in order to prevent shareholders' criticism of him from "hindering our ability to cooperate as a team and to focus fully on our businesses."
Case, who oversaw America Online's merger with Time Warner which was approved by the US Federal Trade Commission in January 2001, will remain as a board member of AOL Time Warner.
The merger was valued at 155 billion US dollars when it was announced in January 2000.  The merger was approved by the European policy makers later that year.
Case said in a statement: "As you expected, this decision is personally very difficult for me, because I hoped to serve as chairman of this conglomerate for years to come.  And as an architect of the merger, I have always thought it was important that I stay as chairman and help get things back on track."
He stressed: "First of all, this company does not need uneasiness at this critical moment.  As some shareholders still focus their dissappointment with the company's post-merger performance on me personally, I have decided that we should take steps now to prevent it from hindering our cooperation as a team and to focus fully on our businesses."
AOL Time Warner's Internet arm, America Online, said that it expects its advertising and commerce sales for 2002 to drop to between 1.5 to 1.6 billion US dollars from  2.7 billion in 2001.
Whereas, the total revenue will be between 8.8 to 9 billion US dollars against the 8.718 billion US dollars in the preceding year.
The company estimates that America Online's total revenue for 2003 will remain about the same as that in 2002, while revenues from advertising and commerce sales will drop by 40-50%.
North Korea Withdraws from Nuclear Non-Poliferation Treaty to Defy the Entire World
(AFP, Washington, January 15)  The showdown between the United States and North Korea has escalated from such peripheral issues as "the axis of evil" to an international crisis, threatening to ruin decades of global efforts at nuclear non-proliferation.
Pyongyang declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty on the 10th of this month, resulting in a stand-off with Washington.
Analysts said that at present, the global efforts aimed at nuclear non-proliferation are threatened with failure.  The treaty has already been seriously undermined when the non-signatories India and Pakistan joined the nuclear club in 1998.
Four days after Pyongyang made the above move, five permanent members of the UN Security Council have all taken preventive diplomatic actions on this crisis.
Russia said it will send a special envoy to Pyongyang to suggest an end to this stalemate, while China proposed that the United States and North Korea hold a dialog to reach a compromise.
Meanwhile, in London, Britain and France are discussing this crisis.
International Atomic Energy Agency has warned that if North Korea refuses to abandon its nuclear program, the agency may request the Security Council to take actions.
As far as Russia's and China's moves are concerned, many US observers think such talks may force Moscow and Beijing to decide whether or not to vote against North Korea.
Other countries with nuclear capabilities, such as Iran and Libya, will surely be on close watch for the development of North Korea crisis.
They would notice that North Korea withdraws from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty with impunity, or gets huge sums of funds from the United States in exchange that it stop developing nuclear weapons.
Einhorn, a former arms control official of the State Department, said: "If North Korea is considered capable of withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, they may figure they can make the same move without paying any cost."
Noland from the Institute for International Economics believes that North Korea may have made a tactical mistake because its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will make the international community more determined than ever to resolve this issue.
Japanese Court Rejects Multi-million-yen Compensation Lawsuit by Former Chinese Slave Laborers
(AFP, Tokyo, January 15)  A Japanese court today rejected a 132 million yen (1.1 million US dollars) compensation lawsuit filed by six Chinese who were forced to work as slave laborers in a nickel mine in Japan during World War II.
Kyoto District Court Judge Shin Kusumoto said that although what the government and Nippon Yakin Kogyo Co. did in 1944 jointly was illegal, he rejected this lawsuit based on the Civil Law that allows a 20-year statute of limitations.
Kusumoto said: "The defendants' obligation has expired."
Five former Chinese slave laborers, including the 72-year-old Liu Zonggen and a family member of a deceased slave laborer, have sought unpaid wages, compensations and apologies from the Japanese government and Nippon Yakin Kogyo Co.
The six people worked as slave laborers for Nippon Yakin for a period of one year during which they were often beaten up and poorly fed and clad.
Nippon Yakin argued that the company was in no position to oppose the national policy, while the Japanese government, on the other hand, said it has no need to provide compensation to the plaintiffs according to the constitution at that time.
Jiji Press reported that after the court announced its ruling, Liu Zonggen said at a press conference: "This is an inhumane ruling."
He said they will file an appeal.
Liu Zonggen said: "I've got the support from many Japanese friends.  I'll fight to the end."
The plaintiffs' attorney pointed out that this ruling "violates the historical record," and demanded that the Japanese government and Nippon Yakin pay compensations and offer apologies to resolve the issue.
Kyodo News reported that this is the first time such argument has been rejected in lawsuits involving war compensation.
In 1944, the Japanese military abducted about 200 Chinese and then sent them to work as slave laborers in Oe Mountain Nickel Mine in Kaya Cho, Kyoto Prefecture.
Alcatel Says Sales in Fourth Quarter Last Year Grew Nearly 30%
(AFP, Paris)  Alcatel, the French telecommunication equipment manufacturing giant hit hard by the downturn in the telecom sector, said that its sales in the fourth quarter of 2002 should show a growth of nearly 30% over the preceding quarter.
The sales growth reflects the stronger-than-expected seasonal factors as well as the sustained sales of the broadband and mobile infrastructure equipment.
Alcatel noted that after taking into account reserves on inventories of 150 million euros (158.4 million US dollars), the fourth quarter income from operations will be around the break-even point.
Alcatel issued a statement saying that cost-cutting measures are being carried out as planned.
The stock market in Paris welcomed Alcatel's announcement, and Alcatel shares surged by 16.91% to 6.5 euros in the early afternoon trading.
Balcon, an analyst with Global Equities, said: "The upward revision in the fourth-quarter sales figures came particularly unexpected."
Alcatel's Chairman Serge Tchuruk said he still expects Alcatel to reduce the break-even point to 3 billion euros by the end of 2003, which means profitability can be achieved with less sales.
Alcatel added that the company's annual income will be announced on February 4.
Japan Unlikely to Expect a Real Growth of 1.5% until 2006
(AFP, Tokyo)  Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported today the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy (CEFP) of the Japanese government has deferred the estimated time for Japan's economy to reach a real growth of over 1.5% by two years to fiscal 2006.
CEFP also forecasts that in the next five years the total issuance of annual government bonds will reach 40 trillion yen due to the longer-than-expected time it takes to reduce budget deficits.
The report said that the mid-term economic outlook that aims at mapping out the guidelines for the economic and fiscal operations for the next five years is scheduled to be finalized on the 20th of this month.
The mid-term economic outlook report was worked out in early January last year, and CEFP is currently working on its revision which is expected to be approved at the Cabinet meeting by the end of this month.
It is reported that the current edition of the mid-term economic outlook report and a test calculation done by the Cabinet expect a real growth of 1.5% for fiscal 2004 and a nominal growth of 2.7% for fiscal 2005.
However, the revised edition projects the real growth rate in 2004 will be only 0.9% and the nominal growth rate only 0.8%.
The report said the revised edition also forecasts that a real growth rate of 1.5% or over will not materialize until fiscal 2006.
A nominal growth rate of 2.5% or more will not occur until fiscal 2007, postponing the original dates by two years.
The report pointed out the revised outlook also extends the timetable to end deflation by two years.
Australia Faces Most Devastating Bush Fires in 50 Years; 1 Feared Dead
(AFP, Sydney, January 18)  Bush fires are ravaging Australia, having destroyed nearly 40 homes as of today, and are threatening residential houses in the suburbs around the capital city of Canberra.  With gusty winds and rising temperatures, the fires are expected to spread further.
Australian officials said that according to unconfirmed reports, the blaze that has spread to dozens of suburban towns of Canberra and other areas in the ACT has already left one person dead and several missing.
Brown, an officer with the Federal Police, said that the police are trying to verify the report that at least one person has died in the inferno, but some people have already been confirmed missing.
As strong winds have fanned the bush fires out of control in the northern, southern and western mountainous areas in Canberra, the ACT authorities have declared a state of emergency today for the entire region.
On the other hand, fire service authorities said as bush fires are approaching heavily populated areas, the military has been called in to join thousands of firefighters in putting out the fires.
Threatened by the bush fires that some officials described as the most devastating in 50 years, rural town residents in the mountainous regions within the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales and Kosciuszko National Park have all been immediately evacuated.
Rural Fire Service Commissioner Koperberg said: "It is a serious situation.  The Snowy Mountains may be facing the most serious threat in 50 years."  Over a thousand firefighters are fighting a losing battle, unable to prevent the blaze from engulfing the 80,000 hectares of bushland in New South Wales.
Japanese Emperor Akihito's Surgery to Remove Cancerous Prostate Gland Successful
(AFP, Tokyo, January 18)  Japanese Emperor Akihito underwent surgery today to have his cancerous prostate gland removed.  Doctors of the imperial household said the operation went smoothly and the cancer cells didn't seem to have spread to other organs.
Ichiro Kanazawa, medical supervisor of the Imperial Household, said at a press conference held at University of Tokyo Hospital: "The operation went smoothly as planned and was successfully completed.
His Majesty has waked up from anesthesia and had a few words with Empress Michiko and Princess Sayako."
He added: "Judging from appearances, we don't think the (cancer) has spread."
Kanazawa said that doctors will perform additional tests to make sure that the cancer is limited to prostate gland only.
The surgery, jointly performed by six doctors, lasted 3 hours and 40 minutes and removed Akihito's entire prostate gland.
The 69-year-old Akihito assumed the throne in 1989, and this is the first time ever that an emperor has undergone an operation at a hospital other than the Hospital of the Imperial Household.
Doctors said that Akihito is scheduled to recuperate for about a month.
Kanazawa indicated as Akihito did not bleed much during the operation, the doctors used his own blood for transfusion.
Prior to the operation, the doctors stored Akihito' blood in advance.  The quantity is not specified.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda said that the government is relieved with the emperor's successful surgery and hopes for his recovery at the earliest time.
Shortly before Akihito was admitted to hospital, government officials said, the 42-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito had assumed the emperor's constitutional duties on a temporary basis.
This is the first time that a Japanese emperor has transferred his duties due to hospitalization.
Philippines Masses Troops to Combat Threats of Communist Guerrilla
(AFP, Manila, January 20)  The Philippine security forces are massing various units in order to combat the numerous attacks by the communist guerrilla in some areas of this Southeast Asian archipelago.
Brigadier General Purificacion said today that the New People's Army is "attempting to mass troops in some areas," including the northern Philippines, provinces south of Manila and some central islands.
He added: "They are intensifying attacks on some areas that they think are weak in military strength," or "attacking and harassing the troops in scarcely populated areas."
Other officials said that the NPA has intensified attacks on the so-called "soft" targets such as telecommunications and power facilities.
Last week, the national police chief Ebdane required the telecommunications firms to invest hundreds of millions of US dollars in security protection to guard against the NPA attacks.
Purificacion said: "The armed forces have redeployed more troops in areas most prone to threats."
Purificacion said the number of the NPA troops has declined at least 23% to about 9,000 from 12,000 to 13,000 two years ago.
At least 5,000 of them are "armed regulars," which were about 6,000 in early 2001.
He said the government forces repelled them from more than 400 villages where the NPA frequented.
He said: "We're slowly but steadily winning back people's confidence."
National security advisor Golez said last week that the serious political and military setbacks the NPA suffered would force it and its mother organization, the Communist Party of the Philippines, back to the negotiation table.
After the rebels assassinated two Philippine legislators, Philippine President Arroyo ceased negotiations with the communist party in mid 2001.
Last year, the United States included the NPA and the CPP in its international blacklist of "foreign terrorist organizations."
Washington, Canada, and many Western European governments also agreed to track down and stop the foreign funding sources of the rebel troops and freeze their overseas assets.
Growth of Mobile Phone Users in Mainland China to Slow Down
(AFP, Beijing, January 21)  This year, the number of new mobile phone users in mainland China is expected to decrease to 52 million.
It was 61.9 million last year.
However, Beijing Morning Post, citing the forecast by the Ministry of Information Industry, said that the target may be underestimated.
In January last year, the Ministry of Information Industry forecast that there would be 55 million new mobile subscribers that year, but the actual figure turned out to be 61.9 million.
There were 206.6 million mobile phone users in mainland China at the end of last year, up 42.7% from the previous year.
Beijing noted that mainland China became the largest fixed-line and mobile phone market in the world in July last year.
The year before that, the number of mobile phone users alone already topped the world.
The report said that in the meantime, Wu Jichuan, minister of Information Industry, projected that the decline of investment in the fixed assets in post and telecommunication industry last year will come to an end this year, but the amount of investment may remain the same.
Last year, the investment in the fixed assets of post and telecommunication industry fell by 20% to 210.6 billion yuan.
Investment by telecom companies accounted for 97% of the total investment.
Wu Jichuan predicted that this year, investment in the fixed assets of post and telecommunication industry will reach 210 billion yuan, slightly less than that of last year.
The report said that the Ministry of Information Industry forecasts that the number of new fixed-line phone users this year will be 33 million, below the 35.40 million last year.
At the end of December last year, the number of the fixed-line phone users in mainland China reached 214.4 million, up 35 million from the previous year.
Wu Jichuan also pledged to boost competition and speed up the establishment of a telecom regulator.
He said: "The optimization of telecom regulations has become the most crucial issue in the industry.
We will accelerate the drafting of telecommunications laws and revise the postal laws and the regulations on wireless telecommunications."
WHO Starts to Elect New Director-General
(AFP, Geneva, January 21)  The nomination for the World Health Organization's new director-general will unfold in the coming week.  Mocumbi, prime minister of Mozambique, Piot, the Belgian who heads the UN AIDS prevention agency, and Jong-Wook Lee, a tuberculosis specialist of South Korea, are the three most likely people to come through.
The WHO executive board meeting will start from today to eliminate the number of candidates to five and nominate one person on January 28 to succeed Ms. Brundtland, the Norwegian who will soon leave her post as director-general.
However, the nominee will still need to be finally confirmed by the WHO's 192 member states in May.
Diplomatic officials said that of the candidates running for the director-general, three are most promising: Mocumbi, prime minister of Mozambique, Piot, UNAIDS executive director, and Jong-Wook Lee, director of WHO's Stop TB program.
According to an unofficial rule, the United Nations always tries its best to let people from different parts of the world serve as directors of its chief agencies.
Some Western diplomats admit that Piot, as a European, has been at a disadvantage from the very beginning.
A diplomat said: "Now it's time for people from southern nations to take the lead."
Robert Redford Calls on Independent Filmmakers to Help Protect Freedom of Speech
(AFP, Park City, Utah, January 20)  Amid the US-led war against terror, Robert Redford, the screen icon, called on independent filmmakers to help prevent the freedom of speech from being eroded.
Yesterday, at his Sundance Independent Film Festival, Redford spoke out candidly for the freedom of citizens both at home and abroad.  His remark was obviously an indirect attack on the Bush administration's policies.
Redford warned that the US freedom of speech and other basic rights are under threat, but independent movies can help keep alternative artistic and political views alive.
He said: "One of the virtues of independent filmmaking is that it is not only unburdened by commercial dogmas but it also is not restricted in expressing different points of view."
Redford, founder of the Sundance Film Festival, said that he is planning to revise the rules for this annual independent filmmakers' festival so that their works can be shown in major US cities.
Park City, Utah, has been hosting this film festival for 22 years.
Redford, who starred in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "All The President's Men," said: "Freedom of speech is our most precious virtue, and we must keep it in mind to guard it well."
OPEC Founder: War on Iraq will Cause Oil Price to Soar up to 100 Dollars
(AFP, Doha, January 21)  According to Yamani, former minister of oil of Saudi Arabia, if Iraq sets the oil fields on fire in the event of a US-led war, the price of crude oil will soar up to 100 US dollars a barrel.
This OPEC co-founder said last night that Hussein "will destroy Iraqi oil wells, which will lead to the decline of the strategic oil reserve and cause the oil price per barrel to soar up to anywhere between 80 and 100 US dollars."
He said at a press conference in Doha, capital of Qarta, that if the United States "attacks Iraq, it may trigger a global disaster."
He further pointed out: "Bombing the oil reserve and oil industry in Iraq may lead to a dramatic rise in crude oil price to the range of 80-100 US dollars."
Yamani said: "(The US) military actions against Iraq will destroy the oil wells and cause serious turmoils in Iraq.  Consequently, the oil price will surge, which will lead to a global recession."
North Korean Delegation: North Korea has no Intention of Making Nuclear Weapons
(AFP, Seoul)  South Korean officials said that the North Korean delegation to the inter-Korean ministerial talks indicated today that North Korea has no intention of making nuclear weapons.
Rhee Bong-Jo, a spokesman for the South Korean delegation, said: "North Korea emphatically pointed out that it has no intention of making nuclear weapons."
While briefing on the first official talks that lasted an hour, Rhee Bong-Jo noted that the North Korean delegation made the above remark after South Korea urged the Pyongyang regime to abandon its nuclear ambition.
Rhee Bong-Jo said: "South Korea stressed there will be no further progress in the entire inter-
Rhee Bong-Jo added: "Through this round of talks, we hope to persuade North Korea to take more concrete steps," and reverse its decision to reactivate the nuclear facility that is capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium.
The focus of this inter-Korean ministerial talk is on peaceful reconciliation and humanitarian issues, but South Korea, as a traditional US ally, has already indicated that Seoul authorities have decided to use this opportunity of inter-Korean talks to express the international concern over the nuclear stand-off.
North Korea claimed that the nuclear stand-off is a bilateral issue involving only the United States, and the intervention of other nations will only make the issue more complicated.
Largest US Chain Retailer Kmart May See Profit Sooner
(AFP, Troy, Michigan, January 26)  Kmart Corp, the largest chain retailer in the United States, said that after a year of restructuring, the company will get out of bankruptcy and return to profitability by 2004.
The reorganization plan that Kmart Corp. proposed the day before yesterday mainly relies on two investment firms, ESL Investments Inc. controlled by the millionaire Lampert of Connecticut and Third Avenue Value Fund of New York.  The two investment firms are going to invest 352 million US dollars to bail out Kmart Corp.
However, the reorganization plan is not yet approved by the creditor banks, investors and suppliers.
The chain retailer with a history of a century said that it will continue to communicate with the creditor's committee and hope to emerge from bankruptcy before April 30.
US FBI, the SEC and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce are investigating Kmart Corp. on grounds that its top executives are suspected of financial fraud.
The company's board of directors is also conducting internal investigations and noted the night before that it has found "reliable and convincing evidence" that show ten chief executives violated management responsibilities.
Kmart Corp. declared bankruptcy a year ago after losing 2.4 billion US dollars in 2001.
It estimates a loss of 3.26 billion US dollars in 2002, and said the night before that the company will lose another 286 million US dollars this year.
Kmart Corp. has already closed 283 stores and laid off 22,000 employees.  At present, it plans to close 300 more stores and lay off 37,000.
Powell: US Gets Support from over Ten Allies for its Strikes on Iraq
(AFP, Davos, Switzerland, January 25)  US Secretary of State Powell said that the US plan to attack Iraq has got the support of over ten allies.
At this time, he is preparing his speech on the US policy for his attendance at the World Economic Forum.
Under tight security measures, Powell arrived at the Swiss ski resort of Davos to address the annual meeting of the global political and business leaders on Sunday.
In the meantime, anti-globalization protesters are also gathering here.
Concerns about a possible Iraqi war have cast a shadow over this year's meeting.
The participating OPEC nations are trying today to ease the concern that the world oil supply may be disrupted once the United States attacks Iraq.
Powell told reporters who traveled with him to Davos for coverage: "Quite a number of countries have already indicated ... (they) will act with us in unison;" even if the UN Security Council does not back the war, he added, these countries will not change their stances.
Powell said: "We'd not be alone; that's for sure.
I can name over ten countries just by memory, and I think more countries will show their support."
US officials said Powell will talk respectively with Turkish Prime Minister Gul and Australian Prime Minister Downer during the meeting in Davos.
Turkey, the most important NATO ally of the United States, is resisting pressure so that it can join the US-led war against Iraq.
Whereas, the Australian government has pledged to send troops to join the war regardless of domestic opposition.
Daschle Says President Bush Should Come Forward with Solid Proof of Hussein's Violations
(AFP, Washington, January 28)  Senate Democratic leader Daschle challenged President Bush's way of proving Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.  He went on to doubt whether the White House has already had a "guiding principle" to prove attacks on Husseins are justified.
Daschle asked: "If we hold the proof that Iraq possesses nuclear and biological weapons, why don't we show that proof to the world ? - just as President Kennedy did 40 years ago when he held the photographs of offensive missiles in Cuba and immediately instructed Stevenson, the US ambassador to the United Nations to announce them at the UN General Assembly."
It was during the time when the UN arms inspectors were reporting to the UN Security Council on Iraqi compliance with arms reduction orders that Daschle vehemently assailed President Bush in his report at the National Press Club.
He said: "At a time when we have begun to fight the war on terror, the American people have the right to know why thousands of the US troops are sent to the battlefield at the risk of their lives and why the United States wants to spend billions of dollars, risk offending allies and inflame adversaries to attack Iraq."
Daschle said: "In a democratic country, the president should do all he can to clear people's doubts, which is very important."
He was referring to the polls that show a decreasing support of the American public for President Bush.
White House has been rotating all kinds of reasons to explain the urgency of overthrowing Hussein, including its threat to the neighboring countries, poisoning of the Kurds, attempt to kill the former President Bush, alleged involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, manufacturing weapons of mass destruction and so on, making people wonder which one is to believe.
He said: "It makes people doubt the government has already had a supreme guiding principle."
Parts of Northwestern Australia Devastated by Floods
(AFP, Townsville, Australia, January 28)  While many areas in Australia are being ravaged by droughts and forest fires, parts of the remote northwestern region are devastated by floods.
Today, disaster relief authorities must send fresh food supplies to Burketown in Gulf of Carpentaria area in Queensland.  The area has been marooned by floods for nearly three weeks.
Burketown has seen frequent flooding and once lost contact with the outside world for months due to floods.
However, the local council chief executive Turnour said that this year's flooding came upon the town all of a sudden.
He said: "No fresh milk, fruits or vegetables; the supply of bread is also limited.  There are only a few foods left in stock before the roads are reopened."
"The flood came with such suddenness that the last freight truck entering town also got stranded.  The truck came into town on the 22nd, and we were cut off from the outside world the very same night."
Turnour said the water level has fallen in the past few days; if no more rain keeps coming, the roads should become accessible this week.
Trad, a bar owner in Burketown, said he has been careful to ensure the supply of beers because people, unable to work due to floods, flocked to his bar for drinking.
Trad said: "They're drinking, playing cards and fishing to while away the time."
"The expanse of water is now replaced by mud.  So even if water is receding from the roads, they are still impassable."
Thousands of Century-old Olive Trees to Adorn Olympic Venues in Athens
(AFP, Athens, January 28)  About 4,000 century-old olive trees will be transplanted to line the 2004 Olympic Marathon route and other Olympic Games venues.
These olive trees will be transplanted from the remote islands of Crete and Zakynthos.
According to the Athens Olympics Organization Committee (ATHOC), these trees would have been uprooted sooner or later anyway due to local construction projects.
ATHOC said that at present these olive trees are temporarily stored; 1,500 century-old ones will be replanted in the future along the 42.2-kilometer Marathon course.
The rest of the old trees will be planted at other Olympic Games venues.
Olive trees are common of the Greek landscape.  The shape of the recently unveiled Olympic torch is exactly that of an olive leaf as inspired by the tree.
An official from the Olympics Organization Committee said: "This proposal represents the committee's sensitivity to environmental protection."
3 million euros will be spent on landscaping along the marathon course.
Protesters and people from adjacent communities say the marathon course mars the local environment as some of the roads on the route will be broadened, which will destroy the pristine scenery still unspoiled today.
Environmental protesters also complain that many trees have been uprooted in some parts of Athens due to the project of the Olympic Games-related tram route.
Exit Polls: Sharon-led Likud Party Wins Israeli General Election
(AFP, Jerusalem, January 28)  Israel held its general election today.  According to the results of exit polls, the right-wing Likud Party led by the incumbent Prime Minister Sharon has secured a victory, taking 32-36 seats in the 120-seat parliament.
Sharon's office said that, Mitzna, leader of the main opposition Labor Party, has conceded the election and telephoned Sharon for congratulation.
It is estimated that the Labor Party will get 17 to 19 seats, fewer than the original 25 seats, the worst election result for the Labor Party since Israel established itself as a country in 1948.
The centrist Shinui Party is expected to gain a substantial number of seats, from the mere 6 in the last parliament to between 14 to 17 seats, threatening the Labor Party's position as the second largest party.
The Shas is expected to win between 9 to 13 seats, fewer than the current 17 seats.
The above estimated results are released after polling stations were closed at 10:00 p.m. by the public TV station and the privately-run Channel 2.
The Labor Party leaders said talks have been started in the hope of forming a workable coalition.  However, the Labor Party leader Mitzna has ruled out the possibility of joining the Sharon administration.
US Senators Plan to Reorganize USOC Torn by Internal Bickering
(AFP, Washington, January 29)  US senators reprimanded the bickering leaders of the US Olympic Committee and vowed to reorganize this world's best funded national Olympic organization.
The USOC has been doing a poor job and been recently torn by fierce internal bickering.
The Senate plans to hold a hearing in February to study relevant measures while the senators who founded the USOC in 1978 will now start about its reorganization so as to inspire faith in the US athletes, supporters, and business sponsors.
Sen. McCain, chairman of the relevant Senate committee, said: "If we want to rebuild the public's confidence in the USOC, we must restructure the organization.
We must propose ways to reorganize the USOC so as to prevent the current problems from resurfacing."
Fierce and childish bickerings broke out among Ward, the scandal-embroiled USOC chief executive, Mankamyer, the USOC president, and Rodgers, the former USOC compliance officer who resigned last week.
Republican Senator Campbell said: "If there were a gold medal for bickering, the USOC officials involved in this bickering would deserve the award."
8 European Countries Sign Joint Letter in Support of US Strategy against Iraq
(AFP, London, January 29)  Leaders of eight European countries, excluding France and Germany, have signed an open letter published in the Times today, calling for Europe to form a united front with the United States in an effort to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction.
Leaders from Britain, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Denmark and the Czech Republic said that the United Nations must force Iraqi President Hussein to abandon weapons of mass destruction, warning the UN credibility is being tested.
The letter published in the Times said: "Our strength comes from unity," and pointed out that the report submitted by the UN weapons inspectors on the 27th testifies that Hussein has been consistently "cheating, denying and failing to cooperate."
The letter was signed by Blair of Britain, Aznar of Spain, Berlusconi of Italy, Barroso of Portugal, Medgyessy of Hungary, Miller of Poland, Rasmussen of Denmark and Havel of the Czech Republic.
They affirm that Hussein's weapons of mass destruction are obvious threats to the world security.
"We must keep united and insist that the Hussein regime be disarmed.
The solidarity, cohesion and determination of the international community are where lies our hope of achieving this goal peacefully."
Thai Authorities Sent Planes to Evacuate Thai Nationals from Cambodia
(AFP, Bangkok, January 30)  Due to an anti-Thai clash that broke out in Phnom Penh, the Thai authorities have sent military transport planes to Phnom Penh to evacuate about 560 Thai nationals.  Today a few hundred Thais have arrived in Bangkok by plane.
Military officials said that Thai Prime Minister Thaksin and top military officials welcomed the first C-130 Hercules plane at Bangkok's military airport as it arrived from Phnom Penh with 170 Thai nationals on board.
The second plane followed, carrying 150 Thais back home.
Two more planes are scheduled to bring another 170 in total back to the country.
Diplomatic staff will take the fifth plane home.
Thailand's supreme Commander in Chief Surayud told reporters at the airport: "We're going to evacuate all of them by this afternoon."
Surayud said five Thais, who suffered minor burns, have already been sent to the hospital near the airport for treatment.
In Cambodia, hundreds of protesters attacked and torched the Thai embassy in Phnom Penh on the 29th.
This incident of Cambodians attacking Thais that broke out in Phnom Penh was ignited by a popular Thai actress, who claimed that Cambodia's famous ancient temple complex of Angkor Wat was stolen by Cambodians from their neighboring country.
Angry protesters looted Thai-owned stores in Phnom Penh.  The Royal Phnom Penh Hotel owned by Thais reportedly has been reduced to ashes.
Ethnic Chinese in Asia Celebrate Year of Goat and Hope for Economic Prosperity in New Year
(AFP, Hong Kong, February 1)  As Asia ushered in the Lunar New Year today, tens of thousands of people swarmed into the temples to pray for a turn of better luck and prosperity after having weathered one more year of economic downturn.
In Hong Kong's famous Wong Tai Sin temple, thousands of people poured into the temple as soon as the clock struck midnight, vying to be first to offer prayers on the Year of the Goat.
A middle-aged man, after squeezing through the heaving crowds to offer joss sticks, said: "I prayed for world peace and for the Hong Kong people to make more money."
His female companion said: "I prayed for good health, and no more wage cuts for workers."
In Taiwan, about 20,000 people waited in a line of several kilometers to get the red packets of NT$200 from President Chen Shui-bian when he returned to his home town to give out red packets.
As the Presidential Office had prepared only 15,000 red packets, thousands had to go home disappointed.
In China, three quarters of the entire population of 1.3 billion reportedly celebrated the Spring Festival by watching television.
State-run CCTV claimed that its four-hour Spring Festival special program attracted as many as  975 million viewers.
Of those who were able to tear themselves away from the TV screen, many celebrated the New Year by eating dinners at their cities' restaurants.  Many famous restaurants were reported to be fully packed.
In Indonesia, this is the first time that the Lunar New Year has been designated as a national holiday, a victory of the ethnic Chinese's fight against the extensive discrimination they have long suffered.  Now they can celebrate the Spring Festival with joy.
Russian Experts: Space Shuttle Disaster May Lead to Temporary Suspension of ISS
(AFP, Moscow)  A Russian space expert pointed out that the tragedy of the US space shuttle Columbia's disintegration on its way back to Earth may lead to the temporary suspension of manned missions on the International Space Station which rely on the US space shuttles and Russian spacecraft.
This Russian space expert, who did not wish to be named, told the Russian media Interfax that the accident of Columbia's disintegration on its re-entry of the earth's atmosphere will force the astronauts on the ISS to return to Earth and switch the ISS to automatic pilot operation for some period of time.
He noted if the age of the space shuttle is confirmed as the cause of the accident, the United States will freeze all space shuttle missions to prevent similar diasters from happening again.
He further pointed out it is very likely that the United States will not send astronauts again to the ISS until 2007 or 2008 and must build new spacecraft.
If the US space shuttles stop operation, only Russia can send astronauts to the space station by its spacecraft Soyuz.  However, as the Russian Space Agency is currently having severe financial problems, the United States and Russia may reach an agreement to use Soyuz to maintain manned missions on the space station while using Progress cargo vessels to send supplies to the ISS.
According to the Russian expert, the astronauts currently at the ISS were originally scheduled to take the US space shuttle Atlantis back to Earth on March 1 and should now be expected to continue their stay at the space station.
The participants of the ISS program include 16 countries such as the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada and France.
The Russian expert pointed out the tragedy on the 1st illustrated the unreliability of the space shuttle.  Russia had an accident too in 1971 when a Soyuz-11 craft crashed while returning to Earth, killing the three astronauts on board.
Havel Steps down as Czech President with New President not yet in Sight
(AFP, Prague, February 2)  Havel, the playwright who became a democracy movement hero during the reign of the Czech communist party, said farewell to his public service job today and stepped down from his democratically elected presidential post which he has held for 13 years.
In a televised address, Havel thanked the people for their trust in him, saying: "Without your understanding and goodwill, I wouldn't have been able to stay in office for a brief moment."
Although suffering from serious health problems, Havel still withstood the great pressure of the top position and stepped down as his term ended even if no successor has yet been chosen.
Havel took office on December 29, 1989 and made his first speech to the public on the balcony of Prague Castle on the very same day.  Earlier today he also greeted hundreds of well-wishers on the same spot, saying: "I bid all of you farewell after being your president for 13 years."
The 66-year-old playwright is a dissident-turned-world-class politician, which itself symbolizes the triumph of democracy over totalitarianism in Europe.
After revolution broke out in Czechoslovakia, Havel, once a prisoner under the communist regime, became the president.
Three years later, Czechoslovakia split into two countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.  Havel continued to be the president of the Czech Republic.
Today, Havel handed over the presidential seal to Prime Minister Spidla and Zaoralek, the speaker of the Parliament's lower chamber.  They two are scheduled to share the presidential power temporarily starting from tomorrow until a new president is elected.
The Czech Parliament convened to elect a new president last month, but neither of the voting on January 15 and January 24 yielded any result.
Britain Expects Chirac to Eventually Support Security Council Resolution Authorizing Military Attacks on Iraq
(AFP, London, February 3)  The British government is confident that the French President Chirac will eventually support the UN Security Council's second resolution authorizing military attacks on Iraq.
The British media reported today that Chirac and the British Prime Minister Blair will meet in Le Touquet in northern France tomorrow to exchange views on the latest development on the Iraqi crisis.
The headline of the left-wing newspaper The Guardian reads: "Downing Street predicts Chirac will change stance on Iraq."  The Guardian also quoted sources from the office of the British Prime Minister as saying that there are four factors which will influence Chirac into accepting the British way of thinking.
The center-right The Times also reported, citing British top officials, that Chirac has realized his anti-war position has "gone too far," as he was taken by surprise that seven European countries sided with Britain and signed a pro-US letter on the issue of Iraq published by the international media last week.
Quoting a British diplomat, the Times reported that Chirac likes to be in the spotlight and to be coaxed with sweet words, but he is far from dumb.  It may be too much to expect Chirac to make a 180 degree change tomorrow, but it is still hoped that the summit meeting between the two countries may see signs of Chirac's attitude change.
US Freezes Transfer of Nearly 3,000 Troops in South Korea
(AFP, Seoul, February 3)  The US military claimed that the transfer of some 2,900 US officers and soldiers scheduled to leave South Korea in the coming three months has been frozen so that the stationed troops can maintain readiness for war.
The freeze on this military order of transfer has no direct links with the nuclear crisis in North Korea, but it illustrated the inadequacy of the United States in tackling both Iraq and North Korea.
The US 8th Army stationed in Seoul said today that they have received the rotation freeze order  to maintain the scale of the US troops in South Korea; while similar military deployments are being carried out near Iraq and Afghanistan, the suspension of replacement from US-based military units has also been announced.
The US 8th Army commander Lieutenant General Campbell said in a statement that the freeze of transfer order is intended to ensure the US military strength in South Korea.
Under a defense assistance treaty signed between South Korea and the United States, currently some 37,000 US troops are stationed in South Korea.  The US military in South Korea has been on alert ever since North Korea's ambition to develop nuclear programs was disclosed in December last year.
Suspected Space Shuttle Debris also Spotted in California and Arizona in Western US
(AFP, Houston)  NASA said that suspected debris from the disintegrated space shuttle Columbia have also been spotted in the states of California and Arizona in western United States, which may provide important clues to why the space shuttle broke up in the air.
NASA's Associate Administrator Kostelnik said: "We have received quite a few reports that debris have been found in California and Arizona."
He said a team of experts has been dispatched to various locations in those states to examine the debris yet pointed out cautiously that so far it is not clear what those pieces are.
Dittemore, the space shuttle program manager, said on the 3rd that NASA has formed a special team to search for debris in areas west of Texas and Louisiana where most of the space shuttle Columbia's wreckage has been found.
Dittemore pointed out such debris can be crucial because it may provide the critical missing part about the cause of the accident.
The space shuttle Columbia was preparing to land at Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 9:16 a.m. (10:16 p.m. Taipei time) on the 1st when it broke up in the air into pieces of burning wreckage.  The seven astronauts on board the space shuttle were all killed.
Investigators are trying to understand why there was a sharp rise of temperature to as high as 16 degrees Celsius on the left side of the space shuttle minutes before the communication broke off while about simultaneously an unusual drag resistance occurred on the left side of the space shuttle, causing the space shuttle to lose control.
Kostelnik indicated that the possibility of finding debris in locations farther west than originally expected can be crucial in determining the cause of the accident.
He said: "It's of critical importance to examine the debris in the early stage of the accident."
South Korea's Special Envoy Calls for Dialogs between US and North Korea
(AFP, Washington, February 4)  US President Bush is faced with strong demands from the next government of South Korea and important allies in the US Congress to urge Washington to hold direct talks with North Korea so as to prevent the nuclear crisis from going out of control.
One day after giving the order to have heavy bombers on alert and ready for deployments, which inflamed North Korea, Bush's senior aides has to defend Washington's policy toward North Korea.
After his talks with Secretary of State Powell, Chyung Dai-Chul, a special envoy for South Korea's President-elect Roh Moo-Hyun, emphasized South Korea's position, saying: "We hope the United States will play a more active role and have dialogs with North Korea."
He added that dialogs between the United States and North Korea should be conducted multilaterally in an international setting.
In the meantime, Lugar, the Republican senior senator on foreign affairs, also urgently called for the United States to engage in dialogs with North Korea.
Lugar said: "In my opinion, the US officials should have talks with North Korean officials to discuss how to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program through an agreement to a complete international inspection."
Powell's deputy Armitage told Lugar's Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the US talks with North Korean officials are just a matter of time, not whether to have or not have talks.
Armitage said: "Of course we'll have direct talks with North Korea; there's no question about that."
However, he said that dialogs will take place only when Washington is convinced that a "strong international opinion" in support of ending Pyongyang's nuclear program has been established.
Germany's Unemployment Rate in January Climbs to New High in 5 Years
(AFP, Frankfurt, February 5)  Official statistics show that the bad weather in winter and the prolonged economic downturn have pushed the January unemployment rate in Germany to a new high in five years, dealing another heavy blow to German Chancellor Schroder, who has been just over 100 days into his second term in office.
In addition, the threat of a possible war in Iraq further dimmed the economic outlook in Germany, the biggest economy in the euro-zone.
It seems likely the hiring freeze in Germany's labor market will continue for months to come.
Statistics released by Germany's Federal Labor Office in Nuremberg show that the number of people looking for jobs in Germany jumped to 4.623 million, or 11.1% of the German working population.  The unemployment rate in January hit a new high of monthly unemployment rate in five year since March 1998.
Last December, the total number of the jobless people reached 4.225 million at an unemployment rate of 10.1%.
The unemployment in winter months in Germany usually increases for seasonal reasons as most of companies, especially those in the construction industry, lay off employees due to bad weather.
However, even after taking this reason into account, the lines for unemployment benefits application last month still continued to grow longer.
Seasonally adjusted data released separately by Germany's Frankfurt Central Bank show the total number of the unemployed in January surged to 4.274 million from 4.212 million last December.
Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 10.3% from 10.1%.
Gerster, the head of the Federal Labor Department, attributed the sharp rise in the number of people looking for work to two factors, the common effect of the winter weather and the poor state of economy.
Singapore's Economic Review Committee: Economy Expected to Fully Recover by 2004
(AFP, Singapore, February 6)  Singapore's Economic Review Committee said that due to the global geo-political and economic tensions and uncertainties, Singapore's economy will have to wait till 2004 for a full recovery.
Singarpore's ERC said in its annual economic review report: "Singapore's economy has not yet completely recovered from the recession in 2001.  The short-term economic prospect in Singapore is dimmed by too much instability in the region, the economic slowdown in Europe, the United States and Japan, the imminent Iraqi war and the trememdous challenges from China."
However, Singapore's economy this year still has reasonable chances of growth, though a full recovery may not be expected until 2004.
Singapore government estimates that following a 2.2% economic growth rate of last year, this year may see a growth rate of between 2% to 5%, though still far below the average annual growth rate of 7.3% that Singapore has enjoyed since 1985.
ERC also recommends that the government defer the restoration of the Central Provident Fund  contribution rate for employers and consider no raise of the CPF contribution rate for two years to avoid burdening employers during the current difficult time and to help reduce unemployment rate and send a strong message to foreign investors.
Yao Ming Feels NBA Stardom Comes Too Fast
(AFP, Atlanta, Georgia, February 8)  After signing a contract to advertise for the beverage product Gatorade by shooting a commercial with the baseball star Jeter and the American football star Manning, Yao Ming, the Chinese giant who has become the newest US basketball icon, was met with more than a hundred reporters trying to capture his every word and movement.  He could not but feel all this has come too fast though he managed to carry himself amidst such chaos with the composure and wisdom of a Confucius.
The 22-year-old Huston Rockets center will be the starter in the 52nd NBA All-Star Game to be held here tomorrow and become the first Asian NBA star.
Other NBA stars such as Duncan and Iverson all suffered considerable loneliness by comparison with this Chinese giant who has drawn the attention of a global crowd of fans.
Yao Ming said: "The attention I received is obvious.  This is only one aspect of the pressure I've got.  This is something very special.
I wish to stay in my hotel room, but as a basketball player, this might be the luxury I can't have."
Well, it might be indeed a luxury to wish for when most people can usually only see your tummy at eye level and your face frequently appears in TV commercials.
When you are making money by the millions and replacing Air Jordan to become the chief pitchman of basketball, your life is inevitably a hustle and bustle.
Yao Ming said: "All this is happening too rapidly, too fast.
You don't want to get everything at the very beginning, you want to slowly merge into NBA, not like this.
But all this is beyond your control."
Content with Life, Hingis Has No Desire to Return to Tennis
(AFP, Paris, February 7)  Hingis, the Swiss female athlete who was formerly ranked No. 1 worldwide in women's tennis after winning 5 Grand Slam singles championships and 8 doubles championships between 1997 and 2000, indicated today that she has no desire to return to tennis.
However, the 21-year-old Serena Williams believes that Hingis, who started her career at 14, peaked too early and got burned out both physically and mentally.
Younger Williams said after she made the top four in Paris indoor tennis tournament: "I don't think Hingis has officially retired from tennis.  She is just tired.  She had been around in the tennis world for years while I was still goofing around before I was 17.  Sometimes I felt tired of it too, and I could really understand how she felt."
Hingis has recovered from an ankle ligaments surgery she took last year.  The operation left her unable to participate in the French Open and the Wimbledon tennis tournament, but she was eliminated by Seles in the third round at the US Open after her comeback.
Her last match was at Filderstadt in Germany on October 10, 2002, where she was beaten
Younger Williams, who has won 4 straight Grand Slam titles, frankly admitted that Hingis has been a big encouragement for all she has achieved today.
Bush Vows to Disarm Iraq One Way or the Other
(AFP, Washington, February 14)  US President Bush vowed today to disarm Iraqi President Hussein's regime "one way or the other."
He said: "Hussein has weapons of mass destruction, and he has used them.  He is used to deceiving the world, and continues to do so.
Hussein has also formed ties to terrorist networks."
In his speech at the FBI headquarters, explaining various kinds of efforts to prevent terrorist attacks such as those on Sept. 11, 2001, Bush sternly declared: "Hussein is a danger, and that's why he shall be disarmed -- one way or the other."
This is the first public response Bush has made to the UN Security Council meeting held today in New York.
The meeting is mainly intended to hear the UN arms inspection chief's report on whether Iraq has complied with the UN Security Council Resolution 1441 passed on November 8 last year, which orders Iraq to disarm.
White House Spokesman Fleischer said Blix hasn't provided any reason for people to believe that Iraq is complying with the Security Council Resolution 1441.
He told reporters: "Today the world hasn't got any relief from the news coming from New York, convinced that Hussein has shown arms inspectors that he is disarming.
The situation is exactly the opposite."
Asked when the United States will propose a follow-up resolution aimed to implement the Security Council Resolution 1441, Fleischer indicated "it's too early to tell," but the United States will discuss with its allies on its content and terms.
Countries such as France, Russia and China still propose tougher arms inspection for Iraq instead of a US-led war against Iraq.
Fleischer noted that President Bush also considers military actions as the "last resort."
However, he insisted on the timetable Bush has set, saying that the United Nations has got only "a few weeks not months" to test peaceful disarmament with Iraq, which will then be followed by military actions.
New York Times: White House Studies Sanctions against North Korea
(AFP, Washington)  Citing US officials, the New York Times today reported that White House is studying sanctions against North Korea once Pyongyang fails to abandon its development of nuclear weapons.
The report pointed out that these sanctions will include interdicting North Korea's arms shipment and cutting off the channels through which North Koreans in Japan send money to North Korea.
The report pointed out that the Pentagon and the State Department are working on the detailed plans for sanctions so that the United States can respond promptly any time when North Korea takes its new steps to pursue the development of nuclear weapons.
According to the New York Times report, the first step will be to urge the UN Security Council, perhaps in the next two weeks, to denounce North Korea's recent measures to develop nuclear weapons such as withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and reactivating its frozen nuclear facility at Yongbyon that is capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium.
Yet, the Pacific allies of Washington authorities are still opposed to the idea of sanctioning against North Korea, while the UN Security Council may still focus on the issue of Iraq for the next few weeks.
In the meantime, the New York Times report pointed out, many US officials are concerned if the United States launches attacks against Iraq, North Korea may use the opportunity to promote its weapons production.
US Troops to Conduct Training on Philippine Hostage Island
(AFP, Manila, Philippines, February 17)  The US military trainers will be sent to the hostage island of Jolo in the Philippines this year to assist the country in coping with the terrorist threat from the rebel Islamic groups.
Bunye, a spokesperson for Philippine President Arroyo, said: "This military exercise will be part of overall and ongoing defense and security cooperation activities between the Philippines and the United States, and will continue to focus on enhancing our ability to combat terrorist threats and defend ourselves."
He pointed out in a statement: "The detailed numbers of the US personnel and supporting troops as well as the timeframe of the military exercise are still to be discussed and decided by the Philippine government and the United States."
Philippine Defense Secretary Reyes told media reporters that the US Major General Weber will arrive in the Philippines soon to "discuss all kinds of conditions and details regarding the operation in Sulu."
Sulu, the archipelago in the southern Philippines, includes the island of Jolo.
Golez, Arroyo's national security advisor, said that the military exercise in Sulu will "give the Philippine armed forces the maximum training in counter-terrorism."
Since the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, the US government has been increasing its military assistance to the Philippine government, concerned that the al Qaeda Islamic militants driven out by the US-led military actions in Afghanistan may have established their base in Southeast Asia.
The above concern has been fully confirmed by the bombing incident in the resort island of Bali in Indonesia last year, which killed nearly 200 people.
Most of those who died in the Bali bombing were Western tourists.
Schmid, Founder of German Telephone Operator MobilCom, Declares Bankruptcy
(AFP, Hamburg, February 18)  Schmid, the founder and also the former chairman of German telephone operator MobilCom, has declared himself insolvent today due to the sharp decline in the value of his shares and has filed the application with Flensburg Court in northern Germany.
Schmid holds about 40% of this company that he founded.  Over the past year, the company has been financially struggling on the brink of bankruptcy, which led to the sharp drop of its share price.
The statement pointed out that Schmid's personal assets and properties are also affected.
The court has appointed accountant Gellert to be in charge of his bankruptcy case.
Schmid has been spending so much on the next generation UMTS network development over the time that he was ousted last year by France Telecom, the major shareholder of MobilCom.
MobilCom said in a statement later today that Schmid's personal bankruptcy has no effect on the company's operation or contract.
The statement added that there will be no change on the rescue plan of about 7 billion euros undertaken by France Telecom.  According to this rescue plan, the German government and financial institutions will provide about 100 million euros of financing to MobilCom, which currently employs about 5,000 people.
US-South Korean Military Exercise to be Held in March; North Korea Threatens to Quit Armistice Agreement
(AFP, Seoul, February 18)  South Korea and the United States are going to conduct a large-scale military exercise starting from early March, that will last nearly a month.  North Korea, in response, threatens to quit the Armistice Agreement that ended the Korean war.
At a time when the tensions caused by the nuclear stand-off on the Korean Peninsula have continued for four months and showed no sign of easing off, North Korea's threat to quit the Armistice Agreement can be generally interpreted as Pyongyang authorities' response to the announcement made by the United States and South Korea yesterday of the joint military exercise to be held in March.
The statement issued by the North Korean military accuses the United States of repeatedly violating the Armistice Agreement: "If the US side continues violating and misusing the Armistice Agreement as it pleases, there will be no need for North Korea to remain bound to the Armistice Agreement uncomfortably.
The future development will depend entirely on the US attitude."
However, the US top military officials said that North Korea had said they would no longer be bound to the Armistice Agreement as early as in 1994.
US authorities announced yesterday that the United States and South Korea will hold their annual joint military exercise on the Korean Peninsula from March 4 to April 2.
A South Korean government official said that South Korea issued an invitation to North Korea yesterday, asking them to send observers to watch this military exercise.
The official, who did not want to be named, said: "North Korea's statement to quit the Armistice Agreement is obviously a response to the upcoming joint military exercise by the United States and South Korea."
Earlier, the United States ordered 12 B-52 bombers and the same number of B-1 bombers to get ready to go to areas around the Korean Peninsula.  North Korea strongly denounced this move.
In addition, the Japanese media reported yesterday that the United States has planned to step up its military deployment in Northeast Asia in order to guard against the concerns triggered by North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
Indonesian Authorities Reject Proposal to Increase Security Protection of US Embassy
(AFP, Jakarta, February 19)  The US embassy in Jakarta proposed to Indonesian authorities that a 3-meter-high surrounding wall be built to increase the security of the embassy, but the proposal was rejected.
"The Jakarta Post" and the state-owned "Antala" News Agency both reported today that Jakarta authorities rejected this proposal to build a wall to replace the fence that now separates the embassy and the residences from the outside on grounds that it is aesthetically unacceptable.
Jakarta officials, quoting Mayor Sutiyoso, pointed out that the wall can be built, provided that it be built five meters away from the existing fence inside the embassy compound.
In addition, the embassy must put sod and plant flowers in between the two fences to improve the look of the embassy compound.
Sutiyoso indicated that landscaping can reduce the feeling of the US embassy as a citadel.
Since around the time the United States led the military actions in Afghanistan aimed to overthrow the Taliban regime in 2001, its embassy in Indonesia has been endlessly confronted with protesting activities.
That year, when the former ambassador protested against the Jakarta police for failing to effectively stop the threat from the hardline Islamic groups on the safety of the Americans, the relevant authorities increased the security protection of the embassy.
It is generally expected that large-scale protests will become inevitable if the United States launches military actions against Iraq.
Sony to Actively Promote PlayStation 2 to Cyber World
(AFP, Tokyo)  Japan's electronics giant Sony Corp said that it will start the sales of broadband  connection units for the family PlayStation 2 in retail stores across Japan in May to promote the all-popular Sony game console further to cyber world.
As of the end of December, seven months after Sony promoted its online gaming service in the home market of Japan, Sony has only sold 190,000 broadband connection units.
The broadband connection unit, which consists of a hard drive and an adapter, is currently available for purchase only through Internet service providers.
The aforementioned actual sales figure is disproportional, considering there are 12.5 million PlayStation 2 users in Japan and as many as 50.4 million users worldwide.
Starting sales of connection kits in retail stores in tandem with promotion of more online games is part of Sony's strategy to encourage users to use PlayStation to play online games.
A spokeswoman for Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE), a Sony subsidiary, said: "We'll sell connection kits in stores so that more users can enjoy the fun of online games."
The spokeswoman noted that of the 874 PlayStation 2 games currently available, only one is authentic online game.  Two online games will be added in the coming few months.
About 20 games sold in Japan have some online capabilities.
The price of the broadband connection kit is not yet decided, but the one sold through ISPs is priced at 18,000 yen (150 US dollars) per kit.
Sony has already sold about 570,000 units of narrowband connection kits in North America at the price of about 39 US dollars and some 20 compatible games.
Asia to Have Largest Number of Programmers in the World in 2 Years
(AFP, Singapore, February 24)  A report released by International Data Corp. today pointed out that in the coming two years, there will be more computer programmers and other professional developers in the Asia-Pacific Region than in North America.
In 2001, North America had the largest concentration of professional developers, while the Asia-Pacific Region replaced Europe to become the area with the second largest number of professional developers.
However, the IDC report said that the strong growth in China and India is expected to push the Asia-Pacific Region to the top by 2005.
Asian regions, especially India, are the main source of IT professionals in North America.
IDC said: "In five years, the growth in the Asia-Pacific Region, especially in those big countries such as China and India, is expected to be much stronger than in North America."
IDC said that there were 7.8 million professional developers in 2001, and the number is expected to grow to 13.3 million by 2006.
The report pointed out that by the end of 2001, there were 1.7 million professional developers in Asia.
IDC noted that the drop in the number of IT professionals in North America is partly due to the decline of technology sector in the region.
Study Shows Father's Genes May Affect Timing of Birth
(AFP, Paris, February 28)  According to a report of a Danish study to be published on Saturday's "British Medical Journal," a father's genes may affect the timing of a child's birth.
About 5% of pregnant women go past their term, with a gestational length of 294 days.
At present, this problem is known to have effects on the health of both mother and child, but what causes it remains a mystery.
The Danish researchers tracked 43,000 cases of birth from 1980 to 1992.  The targeted women have at least two children and had a post-term pregnancy for the first delivery.
Only the data of their first two deliveries are used for analysis.
Overall, of those women who had a prolonged pregnancy for the first delivery, nearly 20% had the same experience for their second pregnancy.
However, when the first and the second child had different fathers, the rate dropped to just a little bit over 15%.
Olesen, the lead author of the research report, told AFP: "This is already a lot.
This means if you (with the second child) have the same partner, then compared with those who change their partners, your chance of having a prolonged pregnancy will be over 30%."
The research report said: "If a woman changes her partner every time she gets pregnant, it may reduce the risk of reoccurrence of post-term delivery.
We believe this is a new finding.
But the result means the timing of birth may be decided by a father's genes."
Belgium Demands Prompt Pumping of Fuel Oil from Anchored Oil Tanker
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, January 4 (Reporter Liu Saijun)  Belgian authorities issued an ultimatum on the 4th to the owner of the Vicky, a Turkish ship that anchored in the Belgian waters, demanding that he start pumping the 700 to 1,000 tons of fuel oil carried on the tanker at the latest from 8:00 a.m. on the 5th.
The Belgian media quoted the head of a relevant agency as saying that the fuel oil carried on the Vicky is the same as the fuel oil on the Prestige, which has polluted the coastal areas off Spain, and that the owner of the tanker must ensure prompt pumping of the fuel oil to prevent a vast area of the Belgian waters from being polluted.
Belgian authorities said that if the owner of the Vicky does not meet the above demand, Belgium will seize the fuel oil on the ship and contract a professional firm at its own discretion to pump the oil at the owner's cost.
Bound for New York, the Vicky started out in Antwerp of Belgium on the 1st and anchored about 30 kilometers off the Ostend Coast in northern Belgium after it ran into the freighter Tricolor that had sunken last month while sailing through the Dover Strait.
Parts of Europe Battered by Floods
Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 4  Some areas in several European countries such as Germany, Belgium and the Czech Republic are recently hit by hurricanes and floods, which killed at least 7 people.
With water levels rising in many rivers, traffic on some of the major waterways are disrupted; and highway and rail transportation are also affected.
In the state of Bavaria in Germany, floods overflowed the river banks and inundated the adjacent areas on the 4th, forcing residents to wade through the waist-high water.
The small town of Wertheim is expected to experience the highest water level in 80 years.
Volunteers ferried local residents in rubber boats to the stores for shopping.
In addition, the government officials have platforms built in the old town areas to make it easier for people to get around.
The famous historic city of Cologne also narrowly escaped the disaster in the heavy rains.
The traffic on the 144-kilometer-long Rhine south of Cologne has to be suspended.
However, government officials said as the river water is continuously receding, the worst time is over.
The floods in the small Belgian town of Ninove, however, remain serious.  Two people are already missing.
The Belgian government has decided to call on the military to build sandbag embankments to prevent the villages and roads from further ravages.
Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Calls on the People to Work together for Permanent Peace
Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, January 6 (Reporter Zhang Yadong)  On the 5th, Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe called on the people to work together to end the 19-year ethnic conflict in the country and bring about permanent peace.
On the very same night, Wickremasinghe said in a national televised address that the negotiations between Sri Lankan government and the anti-government Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have entered a decisive stage where nothing could keep them away from the negotiation table as it is now the time to start a journey to permanent peace.
He emphasized that it is still a long way to go before peace can be finally materialized while solving the ethnic conflicts through political channels will ensure the interests of all ethnic groups.
He called on all the parties involved to put aside political differences and speak with one voice determined to seek peace.
Sri Lankan government and LTTE will start the four-day fourth round of peace talks on the 6th in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.
One of the main topics for this talk is the settlement of Tamils, who have been displaced in the war, in the High Security Zones on Jaffna Peninsula in northern Sri Lanka.  However, the government and LTTE have been seriously divided on the issue lately.
Sri Lankan government forces proposed disarmament of LTTE as the condition for resettlement of Tamil civilians, but LTTE claimed that condition is "unacceptable and unrealistic."
Sri Lankan government and LTTE signed an agreement in February last year, and both sides started to enforce an official cease-fire.
Three rounds of peace talks have been held between both parties since September.
LTTE has indicated that it will no longer attempt to establish an independent Tamil state through war in the northern and eastern Sri Lanka and will instead seek autonomous rule of the region under a federal system.
Clay Sculpture of a Goat from Fengxiang, Shaanxi, Becomes Mascot of Chinese Year of the Goat
Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 8  The clay sculpture of a goat, the work of Hu Xinming, a folk artist in Liuying Village, Fengxiang County in Shaanxi Province, has been voted simultaneously as the mascot of the Chinese Year of the Goat at the time it was selected as the design of the 2003 Zodiac stamp.
This is a mascot that Chinese have voted for the first time for their own new year.
Since the end of September 2002, more than 50 media agencies nationwide, including China's Central TV Station, have jointly held an open solicitation in the country for the mascot of the 2003 Year of the Goat.
Up till the end of December 2002, the review committee had received over 3,000 entries on the theme of the "goat."
Among "goats" of various features, the clay sculpture of a goat submitted by the folk artist Huxinming from Shaanxi, with its "charming naivety and auspicious merriment," won the hearts of most reviewers.
It eventually won the laureate of the mascot of the Year of the Goat by an absolute majority vote.
Baoji area in Shaanxi Province has long enjoyed the reputation as "the land of folk arts and crafts."  In 1995 and 2002, Piggy Pillow, a work of handicraft by a folk artist in Longxian County, Baoji, and the clay sculpture of a horse by the veteran folk artist Hu Shen from Liuying Village, Fengxiang County, were respectively selected by the China State Post Bureau as the designs of Zodiac stamps for the years, which were distributed both at home and abroad.
Hu Xinming's clay sculpture of a goat marks the third time a work of folk handicraft from Baoji area has been selected by the China State Post Bureau General as the design of a Zodiac stamp.
Hague Tribunal Medical Team to Verify Bobetko's Illness in Croatia
Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade January 8 (Reporter Yang Chengming)  From Zagreb: The Croatian media disclosed on the 8th that the Hague Tribunal will soon send a medical team to Croatia to verify whether Bobetko, the former Croatian army chief of staff and a war crime suspect wanted by the Hague Tribunal, is too sick to stand trial.
Bobetko was hospitalized for treatment in the middle of last November.
Racan, the prime minister of Croatia, once promised him that he will not be extradited to the Hague Tribunal while he is hospitalized.
A spokesperson for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia issued a statement on September 20 last year, saying that the tribunal had officially demanded that the Croatian government arrest and extradite Bobetko, who committed "crimes against humanity and war crimes."
Bobetko served as the Croatian army chief of staff from November 1992 to July 1995.
The Hague Tribunal indicted him for ordering his subordinates in killing over 100 Serbian civilians and soldiers and in burning down 300 residential houses in September 1993.
Bobetko issued a statement to the media on the very night, denying the Hague Tribunal's indictment and saying he would never yield to the Hague Tribunal, even if it costs his life.
US Defense Department Calls off 2 Missile Intercept Tests
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 8 (Reporter Tan Xinmu)  Lehner, spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency at the Pentagon, announced on the 8th that the US military authorities have decided to call off the two missile intercept tests scheduled for the first half of this year because the development of a new type of booster that launches the interceptor is behind the original schedule.
Lehner told the media here that the Missile Defense Agency this year will need to concentrate on solving the problem of the booster and that the next missile intercept test will be conducted after Boeing manufactures the new type of booster this fall.
Boeing originally planned to begin flight tests in 2000 on the new booster that carries the missile "interceptor," but the tests were postponed due to technical reasons.
After the failure to launch the booster in December 2001, Boeing decided to redesign it and planned to complete the design by this fall.
In the previous eight ground-based missile intercept tests, the US military used a modified "Minuteman" rocket as a surrogate booster, but the results of the tests on this kind of booster were not satisfactory.
The missile intercept tests conducted in July 2000 and last December were not successful because the "interceptor" failed to separate from the booster.
US President Bush ordered the Pentagon to start planning a missile defense system on December 17 last year and try to set up a preliminary missile defense system by September 2004.
However, many experts think as far as technologies are concerned, the time is not yet ripe to set up a missile defense system.
Kadish, director of the Missile Defense Agency, also indicated that if Boeing fails to manufacture the desired booster as scheduled, the entire missile defense system set-up will be affected.
Slovakian President Leaves Shanghai for Hong Kong by Air
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 10 (Reporter Zhou Jierong)  President Rudolf Schuster of the Slovak Republic concluded his visit to Shanghai on the morning of the 10th and left Shanghai for Hong Kong on a Slovakian charter plane.
Zhou Muyao, deputy mayor of Shanghai, went to see off Slovakian President Schuster and his entourage at the airport.
Schuster and his entourage arrived in Shanghai for a visit from Beijing on a charter plane at the noon of the 8th.
During their stay in Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, mayor of Shanghai, met with Schuster on the evening of the 8th and expressed his welcome for more Slovakian businesses to come to Shanghai for economic and trade cooperation.
On the afternoon of the 8th, Schuster attended a seminar by Chinese and Slovakian entrepreneurs.
On the 9th, Schuster attended the opening ceremony of Shanghai Office of the Slovakian Electric Appliance Design and Research Institute and toured Shanghai City Planning Exhibition Hall and Shanghai Museum.
The total trade volume of imports and exports between Slovakia and Shanghai has now reached 30 million US dollars with garments, pharmaceuticals, steel, furniture and auto parts as main commodities of trade on both sides.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 10  Officials from the UN Refugee Agency said that the US government announced the resumption of its program of admitting Iraqi refugees on the 10th after it was briefly suspended.
Officials from the US Immigration and Naturalization Service said that the admission of Iraqi refugees has now resumed after being suspended for a few days, but they did not explain why the program was suspended or resumed.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 11  "The Wild Swans," a Peking opera based on Anderson's fairy tale performed by Peking Opera House of Hebei Province, will make its debut on the capital's stage -- Changan Theater on evenings from January 13 to January 24.

The renowned director Xie Ping-an has not only retained the overall features of a Peking opera in this play but also added some romantic and lively sentiments of a fairy tale.  He has employed many artistic techniques and a large number of theatrical expressions.  His rendering of group scenes, in particular, is phenomenally sophisticated and stylistically unique.
Elisa is played by Zhang Yanling, a Class-1 actress on the state level and a winner of "the Plum Blossom Award."
Her voice is clear, mellow and sweetly resonant.
Against a beautiful scenery of an exotic land, Elisa's heart bleeds for her beloved brothers.  An extensive piece of "fan er huang" is sung with such rich vocal and emotional expression that the heroine's feelings just speak for themselves.

Car Bombing in Colombia Left at Least 4 Dead
Xinhua News Agency, Bogota, January 16 (Reporter Yin Nan)  A car bomb exploded near a district prosecution office in central Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, on the morning of the 16th, killing at least 4 and injuring 26.
The Colombian police disclosed that a rental car parked at the parking lot of a shopping center near the prosecution office exploded at 8:05 a.m. local time.
The dead include a one-year-old child, and five of the wounded are in critical condition.
40 shops and 15 automobiles near the bombing site were damaged.
Authorities suspect that the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC), an anti-government guerrilla organization, is responsible for the incident, because 68 members of the guerrilla organization have been captured in Medellin this week.
Medellin police chief Gallego announced that the police has offered a reward of 500 million pesos (about 172,000 US dollars) for the capture of the perpetrators.
Antioquia Province, where Medellin is in, is one of the areas that have seen the most violent armed clashes in Colombia.  Illegal armed forces such as the FARC, the National Liberation Army and the right-wing paramilitary group and so on have frequent activities in this area.
Multi-billion-dollar Diamond Deal Violates Antitrust Law, EU Concludes
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, January 16 (Reporter Tian Fan)  The European Commission announced on the 16th that the EU preliminarily concludes the 4-billion-euro diamond sales contract signed between De Beers, the largest diamond supplier in the world, and Alrosa, a Russian diamond company, violated the EU's Antitrust Law.
De Beers, a company that has its headquarters both in South Africa and Britain, controls 60% to 65% of the world's rough diamonds.  Alrosa, the only diamond mining company in Russia, on the other hand, is also the world's second largest producer of rough diamonds.
Under the five-year multi-billion-dollar contract signed by the two companies, Alrosa agrees that it shall supply half of its annual diamond output, some 800-million-euro worth of rough diamonds, to De Beers, which will then distribute these diamonds to the markets.
The European Commission pointed out in a statement that the contract will restrict Russia's free competition with the world's diamond markets and lead De Beers to potential abuse of its dominant position to effectively control the quantity, quality and even price of diamonds on the world market.
Under the EU Antitrust Law, the two companies can appeal the European Commission's decision within two months and the European Commission will also continue its antitrust investigation of the two companies.

Japan's Central Bank Decides to Keep Current Financial Policies
Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 22 (Reporter Yue Shaoyan)  At a policy board meeting of Japan's central bank that ended on the 22nd, it was decided that they should keep the current financial policies and maintain the total funds supplied to the market between 15 trillion to 20 trillion yen (1 US dollar equals about 118 Japanese yen).
As for the government and ruling party's request of "setting a moderate inflation target," it was agreed at the meeting that caution should be exercised.

If the financial market shows any sign of insufficient supply of funds in the future, the central bank will pump more cash as needed.
It is learned that the Japanese government and ruling party hope that the central bank will induce the annual domestic inflation rate to 1-3%.
War in Iraq May Lead to Sufficient Supply on the World Oil Market
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, January 22  According to Saudi newspaper Al-Watan that quoted Algerian Minister of Energy and Mines Khelil on the 22nd, in the event of a war in Iraq, there is no guarantee that OPEC can make up for the shortfall of 5 million barrels of crude oil each day on the international market.
Khelil said that among the OPEC member states, only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have the actual spare capacity to increase production.
He believed, "OPEC will have problems meeting the market needs, because even if Saudi Arabia and the UAE have the spare capacity to increase production, they can increase 3 million barrels per day at most."
Since December last year, the price of crude oil on the international market has kept rising due to the general strike in Venezuela and the threat of war in Iraq.
On the 12th, OPEC decided in Vienna to increase the daily oil production by 1.5 million barrels starting from February.
However, as the threat of war in Iraq still looms large, and Britain and the United States continue to build up troops in the Gulf region, the oil price on the international market continued to rise on the 21st.
Khelil said that the international oil price is now more being driven by the tensions of the international political situation rather than supply and demand mechanism.
Shenzhen Luohu Customs Cracks down on Currency Smuggling
Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, January 25 (Li Nanling and Li Xiangzhi)  Shenzhen Luohu Customs, while ensuring a civilized and efficient inspection, spared no mercy in cracking down on the smuggling of currency by means of evading travelers' inspection.
Last year, the customs uncovered a total of 1,023 cases of currency smuggling, which involved an equivalent of over 150 million yuan.  Of these cases, 15 were individual cases involving more than 500,000 yuan (not including cases involving foreign currency notes).
As the largest port for travelers' inspection in the country, Luohu Customs is responsible for overseeing a daily flow of over 250,000 travelers.  If the relatively common practice of carrying cash beyond the legal limit were not strictly regulated, each day might see a considerable amount of capital flight.
In face of this situation, the customs has always taken tight monitoring measures such as frequent checks and careful inspection so as to effectively prevent the outflow of domestic currencies.
A little past 9 a.m. on February 19 last year, a middle-aged woman who walked quickly towing a suitcase caught the attention of the customs officers.
After the luggage went through the machine, the officers found the suitcase contained suspicious objects and opened it for inspection.  They were surprised to see three large bundles of Hong Kong currencies in 1,000-HK-dollar denomination packed in black plastic bags totaling 3 million HK dollars.
This was the largest case of a traveler carrying excess cash abroad the customs has uncovered in nearly two years.
In July and August last year, taking advantage of a larger outflow of travelers during the summertime and the crowded site due to the remodeling of the port facility, some overseas "underground money houses" attempted to smuggle a large quantity of foreign currencies out of the country.
The customs took this matter seriously and made key deployments there to effectively crack down on the foreign exchange smuggling by the "underground money houses."
From July 2 to August 1, Luohu Customs uncovered a total of 4 cases of foreign currency smuggling by the "underground money houses," involving an equivalent of more than 1.46 million yuan.

When the performance ended, many Turks from the audience fought their way to the stage and took out pens and paper or held out their hands to ask the Chinese entertainers for autographs.  Some even climbed onto the stage to take pictures with the Chinese performers to capture the memory.  A few Turkish children were even in tears when they missed the chance to get the autographs or take pictures with the Chinese performers.
A young Turkish girl told Xinhua reporters: "This is the first time that I've seen such a beautiful Chinese dance.
I hope all kinds of Chinese art groups can often come to perform in Turkey so that we the Turkish people can get to know more about the Chinese culture."

Quite a number of firms have intensified training of their employees in learning to speak Mandarin Chinese and offered classes from time to time to enhance the quality of employees' service and their professionalism.
The well-established jewelry shops generally do not offer any discounts, but now as long as mainland tourists pay with cash, they all offer better prices to attract more mainland customers.

(International) Rally Held in Nicaragua to Protest US War on Iraq
Xinhua News Agency, Managua, January 30 (Reporter Yang Wenzheng)  Several hundred anti-war protesters gathered on the 30th in front of the US embassy in Nicaragua and demonstrated their strong opposition against the possible US military strikes on Iraq.

(International) US Personal Consumption Expenditures Flat Last Year
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 31 (Reporter Wang Zhenhua)  A report released by the US Department of Commerce on the 31st shows that although the US personal consumption showed a relatively brisk growth last December, the annual growth rate only broke even with that in 2001 when economy was in recession.
During the last month of last year, personal consumption expenditures, the major driving force for the growth of the US economy, increased 0.9%, the strongest monthly growth since July last year.
Spending on durables rose 6.1%, while spending on non-durables and services only increased 0.2%.
This was a clear sign of slow sales in an otherwise busy holiday shopping season in the United States.
In the last quarter of last year, personal consumption expenditures, which account for about two thirds of the US GDP, rose only 1%, significantly lower than the 4.2% growth rate in the third quarter.  This is the quarter with the smallest growth since the first quarter of 1993.
Economic analysts think uncertain factors such as a possible US war on Iraq, the sharp decline in the stock market and a stagnant job market have mainly held back consumers from spending and consequently led to a sharp slowdown in the US economy in the fourth quarter.
For the entire year last year, US personal consumption expenditures grew 4.5%, matching the growth rate in 2001.
The report also shows that the US personal income rose 0.4% last December.
The annual increase of US personal income last year was 3%, down from the 3.3% increase rate in 2001.
With spending growth outpacing income, the US savings rate dropped from 4.5% in November to 4.1% at the end of the year.
(International) French Troops Attacked in Cote d'Ivoire
Xinhua News Agency, Abidjan, January 31  French troops stationed in Cote d'Ivoire were attacked by local protesters at Abidjan Airport on the 31st.  About 800 young Ivoirians hurled stones at the French soldiers, injuring one French soldier seriously on the face.
Since West African leaders again held talks in Senegal on the civil war in Cote d'Ivoire, the turmoil in Cote d'Ivoire has escalated.
Seydou Diarra, who is vastly respected in Ivoirian politics, was nominated as the new prime minister at the meeting and will return to the country on the 31st to start forming a coalition government.
However, the "Young Patriots," an organization that supports Ivoirian President Gbagbo, resents representatives of rebels taking up such key posts as defense and interior ministers in the future government.
They accused France of coercing Gbagbo into accepting the plan to form the coalition government and called Diarra "prime minister for the French," threatening that death is waiting for Diarra.
According to reports, although the runways at Abidjan Airport have been cleared, several hundred members of "Young Patriots" are staying in the waiting room, ready to boycott the return of Diarra.
The civil war in Cote d'Ivoire has been going on for four months already, leaving hundreds dead in the clashes.
The French Foreign Ministry suggested on the 31st that the 16,000 French nationals in Cote d'Ivoire be evacuated as soon as possible.
(International)  Planned Space Flights of Two Canadian Astronauts Set Back
Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, February 3 (Reporter Hu Guangyao)  According to the local media reports on the 3rd, the plans of two Canadian astronauts to go to space on the US spacecraft in May and November of this year will have to be scrapped due to the accident of the US space shuttle Columbia.
Garneau, Canada's first astronaut and president of the Canadian Space Agency, said that the US investigation of the Columbia accident may hinder the planned missions of the International Space Station; some of the programs may have to be postponed or even canceled.
The Canadian astronauts, MacLean and Williams, were originally scheduled to take their space flights respectively in May and November this year.
The two people are currently receiving training in Houston, USA.
During the 1990s, three Canadian astronauts participated in space missions on the space shuttle Columbia.
Garneau also disclosed that the space science experiments aboard Columbia this time included two research projects sponsored by Canada.
The research projects involve the protein crystal growth with one of the objectives being the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer.
It is also reported that after the Columbia accident, NASA immediately cut short an astronaut training program in Canada.
The seven astronauts, who were receiving training last week at Valcartier military base near Quebec City in Canada, have finished their training and returned to the United States.
(International)  US Construction Spending Posted a Sharp Rise Last December
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 3 (Reporter He Ying)  The US Department of Commerce issued a report on the 3rd, stating that the construction spending in the United States last December rose 1.2% over November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 858.3 billion US dollars.
The report said spending on residential construction last December reached 434.6 billion US dollars on an annualized basis after a seasonal adjustment, up 2.9% over November.
Analysts think that the low interest rate is a key factor for the robust growth in residential construction.
Currently, the US Federal Reserve still keeps the short-term interest rate at 1.2%, the lowest level in 41 years.
However, in contrast with the residential construction, the commercial construction spending in the United States last December was 158.6 billion US dollars on an annualized basis after a seasonal adjustment, down 1.9% from November.
Analysts think that given the current uncertainties about the economic prospect of the United States, businesses are reluctant to increase their investment in building factories and other facilities.
In addition, concerns about terrorist attacks have also adversely affected the commercial construction activities.  Although Bush signed the Terrorism Insurance Act in November last year, it is not sufficient to dispel investors' worries.
For the entire year last year, the growth rate of the US residential construction spending went down from the 2.7% in 2001 to 0.4%, the lowest level since 1991.
(International)  UN Inspectors Found Another Empty Chemical Warhead in Iraq

Shortly after the inspectors found that batch of empty chemical warheads, Iraqi side announced they had found four similar warheads at al-Taji area and turned them to the inspectors.
Blix, chairman of the UN Verification, Monitoring and Inspection Commission, said while he was presenting an inspection report to the Security Council on January 27 that the Iraqi government should have voluntarily declared those empty chemical warheads in the arms report it submitted instead of letting inspectors go in search of them.
On the very same day, the inspectors also inspected seven sites near Baghdad, including a water purification facility, an agro-chemicals plant, two missiles plants and a former center for developing chemical weapons.
The inspectors in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul inspected a sugar factory and a yeast factory on the 4th.
Shanghai Police Confirm Two Men who Fell from Air France Jetliner Were Turkish Nationals
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 10 (Yang Jinzhi and Yang Hua)  After comparing fingerprints, Shanghai police have confirmed that the two men who fell from Air France Flight AF112 on January 23 were Turkish nationals.  They were respectively Karacoban, 20, and Ozuyaman, 19.
At 10:58 a.m. on January 23, Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau got a 110 emergency call, reporting an incident of men falling from the sky in Shengang Village, Laogang Township in Nanhui District.

Offset with the surplus from fiscal 2001, the budget still had a balance of deficit of 300 million pacatas which was expected to be paid off with years of accumulated surpluses.
However, in actual operations, the SAR government managed to increase sources of revenues and reduce expenditures.  The actual revenues increased about 10% over the original budget while the actual expenditures decreased 8% from the budget.
Avila, director of Finance Services Bureau, said that Macau's increased budget revenue for fiscal 2002 was mainly made possible by the successful opening up of the gambling industry and telecommunication industry as well as the rebound in the real estate sector.
Statistics show that in 2002, tax revenues from gambling posted a significant rise over 2001; in addition to a dramatic increase in the number of new telecommunications subscribers, office building transactions started to pick up, netting a gain of about 30% in property transfer stamp tax alone.
(HK, Macau, Taiwan)  Macau Passes Double Taxation Relief Bill
Xinhua News Agency, Macau, February 11  Legislative Assembly of Macau Special Administrative Region passed a bill on the 10th authorizing the SAR chief executive to sign double taxation relief treaties with other countries and regions.
The so-called "double taxation" means two or more tax jurisdictions levy the same or similar taxes on one taxpayer simultaneously for the same taxables.
According to the bill, if double taxation is levied on one and the same taxpayer in Macau, the SAR chief executive has the authority to take necessary regulatory measures till an interjurisdictional double taxation relief treaty is signed.
The member of the Legislative Assembly in charge of examining this bill entitled "Tax System with Respect to International or Interjurisdictional Double Taxation" said that the tax system must promptly keep pace with the current increasing tendency toward globalization of economy, otherwise it will restrict the flow of capital, commodities and personnel.
It is necessary that Macau sign a double taxation relief treaty with other regions as this will not only help Macau to attract foreign capital, but also facilitate Macau's overseas investment.  It is a critical link in promoting the economic growth.
It is said that at present, Macau has already had a double taxation relief treaty with Portugal, and is discussing with mainland China about signing a treaty which is expected to be reached in the middle of this year.

(International) France Proposes to Security Council to Strengthen Arms Inspection in Iraq
Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, February 11 (Reporter Guo Lijun)   On the 11th, the French mission to the United Nations circulated an unofficial proposal among the Security Council members for stronger arms inspection in Iraq.
France proposes to double the official personnel currently conducting arms inspection in Iraq within the short term and then gradually increase the number of arms inspectors till it triples what it is now.
At present, there are about 110 official arms inspectors in Iraq.
France also calls for intensifying aerial reconnaissance or employing the UN security guards to ensure "a freeze" of suspicious sites in Iraq, and using mobile customs patrol units to beef up the inspection of goods entering Iraq.
At the same time, France proposes that a new intelligence agency be established in New York to coordinate all the countries in their efforts to provide intelligence to the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The above-mentioned two agencies are asked to list in order of importance the missions of disarmament Iraq has not accomplished.
It is also proposed that a liaison officer be appointed in Iraq to take charge of daily communication with Iraqi authorities.
France circulated its proposals in the form of "a non-paper."
During the discussion of the Resolution 1441, France and Russia both used this form to express their views.
According to the relevant regulations of the Security Council, this kind of "non-paper" is not as formal as a resolution draft, but it can be upgraded into a resolution draft any time upon the request of the proposing country.
Diplomats here noted that the content of the French proposals does not go beyond the speech made by French Foreign Minister de Villepin on the 5th after US Secretary of State Powell's intelligence briefing, and that this non-paper is a summary and refinement of France's position on arms inspection in Iraq upon the request of some Security Council members.
(HK, Macau, Taiwan) Mainland Tourists Show Strong Purchasing Power in Macau
Xinhua News Agency, Macau, February 14 (Reporter Li Jie)  In recent years, not only has the number of mainland tourists to Macau been increasing but their purchasing power has also been growing rapidly.
According to official statistics released by Macau SAR government, non-resident tourists spent 4.7 billion patacas in Macau in the fourth quarter last year.  Among them, mainland tourists spent 3.3 billion patacas, topping all the tourists from different places of residence.
Since mainland China eased up its policy on overseas travels, the number of mainland tourists taking package tours to Hong Kong and Macau, and going on overseas tours beyond has soared.
Of the 11.53 million visitors Macau hosted last year, 4.24 million were from mainland China.  With the number of visitors coming to Macau surpassing that to Hong Kong for the first time in the fourth quarter last year, mainland China has become the largest source of tourists for Macau.
Although these tourists stay in Macau for an average of 28.8 hours, the average spending per capita reached 2,560 patacas, 64% higher than the mean value spent by tourists from all places.
Analyses show that jewelry and watches, clothing and fabrics, are the hottest commodities among all tourists, accounting respectively for 27% and 23% of their spending in Macau.
The average non-shopping spending, excluding gambling, was 837 patacas per capita, of which food and beverage, and accommodation, the two major categories, accounted for 41% and 36% respectively.
(International) Studies Find Preemies' Learning Disabilities Surmountable
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 15  Low birth-weight preemies are generally slow in their mental development and may easily encounter learning disabilities.
Researchers at Yale University in the United States recently found that this kind of learning disabilities can be surmounted as preemies grow older.
Studies confirm that the neurological system of preemies with birth weight lower than 1,500 gram is prone to problems.  As many as 50% of such preemies need special care while attending school.
Although many earlier experiments show that animals can recover from initial brain damages, there haven't been any related reports of preemies' recovery from brain damage.
According to the media report here, researchers at Yale University have tracked and monitored 300 children born prematurely and given them IQ tests when they were at ages of 3, 4 1/2, 6, and 8.  Most of them are found to continuously gain their learning abilities as time passes.
Tests show that of the preemies classified as "mentally retarded" at the age of 3, half have reached the average level in verbal comprehension and IQ tests after five years.
However, about 23% of the infants have shown no improvement of their mental development due to their severe brain damage caused by cerebral hemorrhage.
Researchers said one of the key factors in the mental development of preemies lies in the family environment.
Children who are from a family of three and whose mothers had high levels of education scored better in IQ tests.
Japan's Bell to Invest in Developing Internet Videophones in Shenyang
Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 16 (Reporter Shi Qingwei)  Bell Net Corporation of Japan has just signed an agreement with the administrative board of Hunnan New District of the City of Shenyang to set up a jointly-funded enterprise and plans to invest 3 billion yen in developing software and hardware for Internet videophones in Hunnan New District.
It is said that Phase 1 of the construction project of this jointly-funded enterprise is slated to be completed between April 2003 to March 2005.  By 2005, the enterprise will have 3,000 employees  and become a key R & D and manufacturing base of software and hardware for Internet videophones in northern China.
Industrial experts believe, as China's technology for Internet videophones is still in the stage of research and development, whereas Bell Net Corporation of Japan is the world's leading player in this field, this project promises good future in China.
Established in 1989, Bell Net Corporation is an emerging IT enterprise in Japan mainly engaged in the development and manufacture of software and hardware for computer Internet phone, and network communications service.  Its sales last year were 12.4 billion yen.
Shenyang, Liaoning Province, is the economic center of northeastern China.
According to Wang, Xiangkun, deputy mayor of Shenyang, the development of Hunnan New District is oriented towards building a key IT industrial base.  At present, more and more foreign IT coorporations are coming to set up their businesses in Hunnan.

(International) EU to Stop Beef Imports from Paraguay
Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, February 20  (Reporter Shen An)  From Asuncion: According to the announcement of the Paraguay Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock on the 20, the EU has decided to stop beef imports from Paraguay due to the Foot and Mouse Disease outbreak in the country.
As reported by the media in Paraguay, Baumgarten, Paraguay's minister of Agriculture and Livestock, announced that the EU made the above decision at the meeting held on the 19th.
In early February, an inspection team from the European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office submitted a report after conducting an inspection in Paraguay.  The report said Paraguay still failed to take sufficient measures related to FMD and there are "serious problems" with the FMD monitoring and inspection systems.  Neither the sanitary control, professional competency, nor the export certification system met the EU requirements.
Paraguay discovered its first case of FMD last October.  After that, prevention and control measures against the plague were taken with the help of other Southern Common Market member states.
Each year, Paraguay exports about 60,000 tons of beef, mainly to countries such as Brazil and Chile.
These countries have already stopped beef imports from Paraguay.
From January to October last year, the EU imported 567 tons of beef from Paraguay.
(International) Austrian Researchers Discover Spinal Marrow Cells that Trigger Chronic Pain
Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, February 20 (Reporter Lin Chuan)  Researchers at Vienna University in Austria found in human spinal marrow a group of neurological cells that have long lasting memory and will become highly agitated the moment they are slightly stimulated by pain. This is another step forward in finding the cause of chronic pain.
Chronic pain sufferers are hypersensitive to pain and eventually have to live with pain in their daily life.
However, what causes the disorder has so far remained virtually unknown.
According to the report by Austrian News Agency, the research team led by J黵gen Sandk黨ler, head of neurophysiology department at the Brain Research Institute, Vienna University, found while doing a biopsy on tissue slices that some spinal marrow cells exhibiting no unusual behavior under normal condition show agitation when stimulated by pain.
The reaction increases as the pain stimuli intensifies.
However, different from other neurons, this group of spinal marrow cells subsequently become oversensitive to pain stimuli and respond dramatically to even minuscule pain stimuli.
Researchers also found that there is a special pathway in spinal marrow cells.  When the cells are stimulated, these pathways will open up to allow in calcium ions, thus setting off a further chain reaction.
According to Sandk黨ler, the reason why chronic pain sufferers are sensitive to even slight pain is that this type of spinal marrow cells have a long-lasting memory which retains "traces of pain."
He noted that this finding can put people on track to search for ways of erasing this memory.
Consumer prices in China up in January
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21 (Reporter Liu Dongkai)  The monthly report released by the National Bureau of Statistics on the 21st showed that in January the consumer price index in China rose 0.4% over the same month last year, the first rise against the consecutive year-on-year decline in the past 12 months.
NBS said that the rise in consumer price index is mainly due to the fact that this year the Spring Festival was at the end of January while last year's was in February.  As the peak periods of holiday spending were different, they were to some extent incomparable.
The other reason is that the weather this year was colder than it was last year.
Of the 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions surveyed in China, 22 posted a year-on-year rise in the CPI, while seven saw a year-on-year drop.
Statistics show that of all the consumer goods, prices of seasonal goods and services such as fresh vegetables, fruits and entertainment went up, while prices of grain, apparel and durable consumer goods and others related to the long term consumption dropped.
The price hikes of gasoline and diesel led to the rise in the price of propane, bringing up further the prices of living expenses.
China Releases First Sex Education TV Series for Elementary and Secondary Schools
Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, February 21 (Zhang Chuanxuan and Liu Wei)  China's first VCD of TV series "Lectures on Sex Education for Elementary and Secondary Schools" has recently premiered in Haikou, setting off strong percussion among teachers and students alike.
The sex education series released by Electronic Audio and Visual Publishing House of Hainan Province consists of the elementary school edition, middle school edition and high school edition.
According to different age groups, the series presents a progressive, step by step introduction to sexuality, including such special topics as puberty, impregnation, procreation, AIDS prevention and care, and sexual psychology, providing answers to questions children have in their minds with vivid audio and visual aids.
At the premiere held in Zhenfa School in Hainan, over a hundred middle school students watched attentively and in absolute silence.
At beginning, many girls merely lowered their heads and kept reading books, unwilling to raise their heads.  Gradually they became relaxed enough to watch the screen.
Lai Ruixing, principal of the middle school, said that schools are badly in need of such materials on sex education as they can eliminate the embarrassment that teachers skip textbook chapters while students read them in secret.
The release of this series has also been endorsed by the relevant departments.
In November 2002, the TV series "Lectures on Sex Education for Elementary and Secondary Schools" won the 10th China's Population and Culture Award issued by the State Family Planning Commission, the China Population and Culture Promotion Association and others.
First Group Package Tour of Chinese Nationals to Malta and Egypt to Set out at End of March
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 22 (Reporter Qian Chunxian)  The reporter was told on the 22nd that the first group package tour of Chinese nationals to Malta and Egypt will start out here on March 28.
The Chinese tourists can travel across the two continents of Europe and Africa within ten days.

The entire journey is estimated to take 10 days at the cost of about 16,000 yuan for the whole package.
Malta is situated in southern Europe adjacent to Italy.
The scenery of blue sky and ocean as well as a mild Mediterranean climate has made Malta a famous tourist attraction in the world.
Egypt is one of the world's four ancient civilizations, and its long history has drawn tourists from all parts of the world.
Malta became the first European country to gain Destination Status for Chinese nationals' personal leisure tours in 2001.  Egypt became the first African country to gain the same status in 2002.

(International) Blix Demands Iraq Start Destroying al-Samoud Missiles within a Week
Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, February 22  According to the local media reports on the 22nd, Hans Blix, chairman of the UN Monitoring, Verification Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), has issued an ultimatum to Iraq, demanding that Iraq start destroying its al-Samoud missiles within a week.
Buchanan, press secretary for UNMOVIC, said that Blix has handed this ultimatum regarding "the destruction of 'al-Samoud 2' missiles and related equipment" to Mohammed al-Douri, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, demanding that Iraq start destroying the proscribed weapons before March 1.
A duplicate of the ultimatum has already been submitted to the UN Security Council.
The experts believe that this ultimatum has put Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in a dilemma.
By destroying these missiles, Iraq will lose the key weapons to defend itself against the US attacks, while rejecting UNMOVIC's request will give the United States and Britain more excuses for taking military actions against Iraq.
Blix and Baradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in their second report on arms inspection in Iraq submitted to the Security Council on the 14th that the evaluation by the UN missile experts has found the range of al-Samoud missiles to exceed 150 kilometers, which violates the related UN resolutions.
(International) Georgian President Stresses on Preventing Illegal Chechen Armed Groups from Entering Pankisi Gorge
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 24 (Reporter Dong Longjiang)  From Tbilisi: Georgian President Shevardnadze stressed in his national radio address on the 24th that at present, the top priority of Georgia's law enforcement agencies is to prevent and completely stop illegal Chechen armed elements from infiltrating the Pankisi Gorge.
Shevardnadze said although Georgia's internal troops, police forces, security departments and ministry of defense cleaned up the foreign armed groups which infiltrated the Pankisi Gorge in last year's special operations, it is possible that some illegal armed elements, disguised as refugees, are still hiding in the Pankisi Gorge.
Shevardnadze said that Georgia's law enforcement agencies have the capacity to uncover these illegal armed elements.
At the same time, he announced that Georgia's law enforcement agencies will soon continue their crackdown on illegal armed rebels in the Pankisi Gorge.
In his address, Shevardnadze emphasized the importance of having cooperation and exchange of intelligence with Russia and the United States in this regard.
The Pankisi Gorge, situated within the territory of Georgia, borders on Chechnya in Russia.
Russia believes that a large number of Chechen armed elements are hiding in the Pankisi Gorge and accuses Georgia of providing refuge to them.
Last year, the relationship between Russia and Georgia was strained for some time due to the issue of the Pankisi Gorge.

(International) Brazil's Risk Index Drops
Xinhua News Agency, Brasilia, February 27 (Reporter Yang Limin)  Brazil's risk index fell to 1191 points on the 27th, down 2.37% from the previous day.
This is the first time that this index has dropped below 1200 points in the 8 months since the financial turbulence broke out in Brazil in June last year.
In the meantime, Brazil's bonds traded on the international market rose by 0.42% on the very same day to the 74% of their face value.
This is also the best record in 8 months.
A country's risk index is closely linked to the price of bonds.  The higher the index is, the lower the price of bonds will be.
Last year, Brazil's risk index once exceeded 2400 points, driving down the price of bonds to 48% of their face value.
Since the new administration took power this year, Brazil's risk index has been continuously dropping.
Recently, there has been an increase in the demand of Brazil's bonds as foreign investors think they are cheap in price and high in returns, resulting in a faster drop of Brazil's risk index.
However, analysts pointed out that although international investors are currently in favor of Brazil's bonds, in the event of a US-Iraq war when there will be a decrease in foreign investment, the country's risk index may rise again to trigger another drop in the price of bonds.
No Signal from ESA's Beagle 2 Probe Since Its Landing on Mars
(Agence France-Presse, London, 1st) - European Space Agency (ESA) spokesman Bonacina said the U.S. orbiter failed to communicate with the European lander Beagle 2 since its landing on Mars.  The hope to pick up a signal from Beagle 2 is now entrusted to its mother ship, the Mars Express.
"We did not have any progress," said Bonacina.
"Right now, we have to put our hopes on the mother ship.  We have to wait for the Mars Express to gather information," he said.
U.S. Mars probe, the Odyssey spacecraft, did not pick up any signal from the European Mars probe, Beagle 2, yesterday.  Beagle 2 carries on the mission to search for signs of life on Mars after it separated from Mars Express for a landing on Mars.
United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched the Mars Odyssey into Mars orbit for another exploration mission.
The Paris based ESA said the Mars Express, an orbiter built by Europe, has now entered the polar orbit.  It will hopefully transmit some signals back next week.
The Beagle 2 was scheduled to land on Mars on Christmas Day, but its signal is still difficult to pin down.
Beagle 2 became the first European spacecraft to land on another planet after it was released from Mars Express on December 19.
During its eighteen-day mission, Beagle 2 was programmed to collect rock and soil, analyze signal transmission and search for all forms of life.
Some scientists have boldly predicted that the British-built spacecraft might have fallen into a crater.

This will be the first time that a delegation from a foreign country is allowed to visit North Korea's controversial nuclear facilities after the country expelled United Nations nuclear inspectors a year ago.
The U.S. delegation includes a China expert from Stanford University, two Senate foreign policy aides and a former State Department official who has negotiated with North Korea.
The delegation's nuclear specialist, Hecker, had led the U.S. Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1985 to 1997.  The first atomic bomb was developed in that laboratory.
Before that, North Korea recently notified the U.S. embassy in Beijing that Pyongyang is ready to attend the delayed second round six-nation talks on the Korean Peninsula nuclear crisis.
U.S. officials pointed out earlier in the week that Pyongyang signaled its readiness to attend the six-nation talks to be convened early this year.
The first round six-nation talks was convened last August in Beijing and ended without any conclusion.  North Korea said later the discussion was "useless".
A second round of six-nation talks was scheduled for December last year but was pushed back to early this year because of disagreement as to what steps should be taken to solve the problem.
Washington has demanded North Korea to scrap its nuclear program unilaterally, while Pyongyang insists on a legally binding security guarantee from United States as a condition for any agreement to abandon the nuclear program.
U.S. Government Said It Had No Part in the Delegations to North Korea
(Agence France-Presse, Washington, 2nd) - U.S. government said today it had no part in the two delegations planning to visit North Korea.  The delegations are hoping to visit the Yongbyon nuclear power plant, the trigger of the diplomatic storm between the two countries.
Two teams -- one of academics and scientists, while the other of Congress aides -- plan to visit North Korea as China strives to bring U.S. and North Korea plus Japan, Russia and South Korea back to the negotiating table.
"We have nothing to do with this group or groups and their reported plans to visit North Korea," said State Department deputy spokesman, Ereli.
"I think the public should clearly understand that the groups or individuals are not representing the government," Ereli said.
One delegation is led by a senior China expert from Stanford University, a nuclear specialist, Hecker, who is a former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, and also includes Pritchard, a State Department envoy talked with North Korea last year.
USA Today newspaper said today the delegation would visit the Yongbyon nuclear power plant but a member of the delegation told AFP the Yongbyon visit is still not certain.
There is now some uncertainty to the visit after it was widely reported by media.  It is not clear whether the team would still be allowed to enter North Korea.
Luse, an aide to Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Lugar, and Jannuzi, an aide who works for the ranking Democrat of the panel, Senator Biden, will lead the other delegation.
U.S. Waiting for Israel's Clarification on Golan Heights Settlement Plans
(Agence France-Presse, Washington, 2nd) - The United States government said today that Israel had not provided a satisfactory answer to U.S. request for clarification about the reported plans to expand Jewish settlement in the occupied Golan Heights.
State Department said Israel responded to U.S. after the reports on Wednesday (31st).
However, Israel's response failed to remove the doubts of U.S. government.
"We have received an answer but not a very clear one.  We are not sure about the situation," said State Department deputy spokesman, Ereli.
He reiterated Washington's opposition to any new settlement activity.
"We have said clearly that we oppose any new settlement activity.  We do not believe such activities are constructive and they should all be frozen," Ereli said.
Media reports said Israel was planning to build nine new settlements in Golan Heights, which was seized from Syria in 1967.  The plans will boost the Jewish population from 10,500 to around 15,000 in three years.
Many Arabian countries condemned the occupying move as illegal.
Toyota Prius Sedan Named North American Car of the Year
(Agence France-Presse, Detroit, 4th) - In the International Auto Show in Detroit, journalists today named Toyota's Prius sedan North American Car of the Year, while Ford's F-150 full-size pickup was chosen as Truck of the Year.
"This award does a lot to validate the hybrid power train," said Press, Toyota's executive vice president in charge of sales.
The 2004 model year Prius has been redesigned by Toyota.  The hybrid-electric car went on sales in October last year with a price tag of US$20,000.  The initial sales have been better than expected.
Last month, Toyota announced a 31 percent increase in production of Prius.
Press said Toyota is hoping the success of the new Prius will stimulate the sales of a similar hybrid-electric powered sport wagon, the Highlander, when it goes on sale later this year.
The new Highland will appear in the International Auto Show in the next couple of days.
The show today was restricted to media.
Ford's redesigned F-150 pickup won the Truck of the Year honor.
According to Lyons, president of a Ford sales division, F-150 is the best selling model in the world.  The 2004 model year F-150 has been redesigned and set an unprecedented sales record in December last year with 84,600 units sold.
Lyons said Ford Motor Company plans to capitalize on F-150's early success and will make untiring efforts to fulfill the goal of selling one million F-series trucks this year.
Zambia Intends to Deport a British Writer for Insulting the Zambian President
(Agence France-Presse, Lusaka, 5th) - Zambian Home Affairs Minister Shikapwasha said Zambia has ordered the depot of British writer Clarke for "insulting" Zambian President Mwanawasa in his column in a privately-owned newspaper, the "Post".  Clarke has to leave the country within 24 hours.
Shikapwasha told a group of Mwanawasa supporters who marched to Home Affairs Ministry demanding the deportation of Clarke, "Mr. Clarke must leave the country within 24 hours.
I want to announce to the whole nation.  We have already taken actions."
However, Clarke said in his interview by AFP that he has not received any notice.
"I am not aware that a deportation order has been issued," Clarke said.
Home affairs permanent secretary Mumba said earlier he had recommended the interior minister to issue a deportation order.
"When you insult the president of a nation, you are actually insulting the people he represents.  Clarke should go back and start writing about his own people," Mumba said.
Clarke has lived in Zambia for many years and is married to a prominent Zambian women rights' activist.
The editor of the "Post", Mmembe, said he would take responsibility for the article published last Thursday and urged the Zambian government to deal with him rather than Clarke.
In the past, the Zambian government has deported foreigners for allegedly insulting the President or leaders in government.
Koizumi Vowed to Continue Economic Reform This Year
(Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 5th) - During a press conference on the first working day after the new year holiday, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi vowed to push forward economic reform this year.  "While the economic situation remains difficult, we are finally able to see signs of a recovery," Koizumi said.
Koizumi stressed that, "I will stick to reform policy and push ahead with reforms.
I will continue reform effort until it lead us to a economic recovery."
Koizumi said he would concentrate especially on parliamentary debate on the privatization of the postal services this year.
"We are finally taking actions on the privatization of postal services.  This is the main axle of the economic reforms," he said.
Koizumi added that he hoped to submit legislation on the related plans to the parliament early next year.
Koizumi pledged to fully privatize the postal services, which have 280,000 employees, by 2007.
Postal services in Japan are regarded the biggest bank in the world because of the 355 trillion yen (US$3.3 trillion) in savings and insurance funds that it manages.
However, the gigantic plan is facing tough opposition from conservative lawmakers in the parliament.
The project got started when Koizumi was acting as minister of posts and telecommunications back in 1993.
Analysts said that Japan's economy is forecasted to maintain a steady growth of around two percent this year, but individuals in the country are likely to remain concerned about further salary cuts and layoffs.
Japan's jobless rate remains above five percent as many companies continue their restructuring efforts to secure profits.
U.S. Begins Fingerprinting and Photographing of Foreign Visitors
(Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th) - In tandem with the support by Singapore (which has the largest airport in Asia) to deploy more air marshals to counter terrorist threat, United States will begin the new measure of fingerprinting and photographing foreign visitors from today.
Washington strengthens its screening of foreign visitors as concerns about security on aviation escalates around the world recently.  In the past week, concerns have prompted the temporary cancellation of several scheduled flights to and fro United States.
Photos and fingerprints are applicable only to foreign visitors that require visas to enter U.S.  The general expectation is about 23 million visitors of this category this year.
The Department of Homeland Security, which implements and runs the "United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology" (US-VISIT), pointed out that citizens from 28 countries, mostly in Europe, are exempted from the aforesaid process.
Immigration organizations criticize the program as an infringement of civil rights and also another step towards a monitored society but Homeland Security Secretary Ridge has been giving every effort to defend the program.
"One of the most important jobs of any government is to protect the security at its borders.  We are launching the program to do this job better and I do not think it is offending.  In fact, the process takes only 15 seconds and obviously no one would care," Ridge said in interview by National Broadcasting Company (NBC).
By 2005, every port of entry on land, sea and air will have the photographic and fingerprinting technology in place.
All U.S. visas and passports will eventually include "biometric identifiers" such as photos and fingerprints etc.
Prior to the launch of the aforesaid program, United States had just raised the level of terror alert in December last year.
U.S. and North Korea Hardened Their Stance: Six-Nation Talks Pushed Back to Middle of the Year
(Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 6th) - South Korea said today that a new round of six-nation talks could be pushed back to the middle of the year as North Korea and the United States hardened their positions.
"I hope talks will be held in the first half of this year at the latest," South Korean Foreign Minister Yoon Young-Kwan told journalists while heading to Chong Wa Dae for a cabinet meeting.
Yoon Young-Kwan made the above comments after Washington dismissed Pyongyang's latest offer to freeze nuclear facilities in exchange for concessions.  Washington further said there are still serious discrepancies to solve before any meeting can be held on the nuclear crisis.
Yoon Young-Kwan said scheduling problems among the six participating nations effectively ruled out the possibility to re-open the six-nation talks in January.
However, he gave no clue as to why a new round of talks could be delayed to June or later.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Losyukov blamed the hard stance of United States and North Korea for the delay.
He attended the first round of talks in Beijing in August last year.
"The reasons are the same old ones -- mistrust and very high demands set by both sides," Losyukov told Interfax news agency after a meeting with senior Chinese officials yesterday.
Yoon Young-Kwan suggested the possibility of a long time delay after North Korea demanded concessions from U.S. again before the start of a new round of six-nation talks.
Washington has accused North Korea of setting precedent conditions before the new round of six-nation talks.
United States is seeking North Korea's undertaking to scrap its nuclear weapon program.
North Korea said it would freeze its nuclear facilities if Washington lift economic sanctions against Pyongyang and resume energy aid.
In the past, North Korea also maintained that U.S. has to sign a nonaggression treaty with the country.
SAARC Concluded: A Glimmer to Better Indo-Pakistan Relation
(Agence France-Presse, Islamabad, 6th) - The South Asia summit concluded today after breakthrough talks between rival nuclear giants India and Pakistan were held during the summit and the sealing of a free trade treaty between participants.  This is certainly an epoch-making event for South Asia.
In her speech at the concluding session of 12th summit of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Bangladeshi Prime Minister Zia described "the summit as an important watershed in enhancing South Asian regional cooperation".
Yesterday, Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee and Pakistani President Musharraf met outside the summit for the first time since a near war conflict in 2002.
The hostility between the two super powers in SAARC had already hampered regional cooperation and development.  The leaders of participating nations were all encouraged with the peace momentum generated by the historic meeting between India and Pakistan.
"I think the standpoints of India and Pakistan have clearly changed and they are striding forward to a peace process," Pakistani military analyst Masood told AFP.
As Pakistani President Musharraf declared the official closing of the summit, he praised the consents on antiterrorism, poverty suppression and the construction of a free trade zone from 2006.
He further praised the summit for "injecting new vitality into regional cooperation".
During the summit, the head of state and foreign minister of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka signed the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), a social charter, poverty fighting strategy, suppression of terrorism and the "Islamabad Declaration".
Bush Praises NASA's Mars Mission
(Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th) - U.S. President Bush phoned National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) today to congratulate the officials behind the Mars Mission.  The President praises their work, which he thinks helped heal wounds from the Columbia disaster.
"The President thanked the NASA team for their hard work, wisdom and strategy, which once again affirm the great American spirit of exploration," White House spokesman McClellan told the media.
Bush said he shared the wonder inspired when the Spirit robot beamed back from the Red Planet the first color image showing the surroundings of its landed spot.
McClellan said, "The president has the same excitement of all Americans when we see the dramatic scene.
Even though we know that it is only a glimpse of Mars by the Spirit."
"The president strongly supports the exploration of space.  He thanks all member of the NASA team for their efforts, without which U.S. cannot continue to be on the leading edge of space exploration and discovery," McClellan said.
World Renowned Japanese Geisha, Kiharu Nakamura, Died in New York At the Age of 90
(Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th) - Japanese Publisher Soshisha Co. Ltd. said Kiharu Nakamura, who abandoned her career as a geisha about half a century ago and moved to America, has died on the 5th at the age of 90 in her home at New York.
Soshisha Co. Ltd. has published 10 books authored by Kiharu Nakamura, including her autobiographical best seller, the "Edokko Geisha Ichidaiki" (Autobiography of an Edo Geisha), in 1983.
"Edokko Geisha Ichidaiki" has been translated into eight languages and adapted into a television show and a drama in Japan.  The book portrayed Nakamura as the only Japanese geisha who could speak English in the pre-World War II era.
French avant-garde artist Cocteau, king of comedy Chaplin and U.S. baseball star Babe Ruth were among the foreign celebrities who were entertained by Nakamura during their visits to Tokyo.
Soshisha Co. Ltd. said Nakamura inspired Cocteau to write the poem "geisha".
According to a statement from Soshisha Co. Ltd., Nakamura was born in the family of a doctor in Tokyo's Ginza district.  She ignored the objections of her parents and became a geisha at the age of 16 in Shimbashi entertainment district.
After years as a geisha in Shimbashi, Nakamura married a diplomat in 1940 but was divorced shortly afterwards.
After the War, Nakamura went back to work as a geisha in Shimbashi and moved to the United States in 1956.
Apart from teaching traditional Japanese music and dance, Nakamura also served as a consultant for operas, including Madame Butterfly.
Nakamura has a son, who is now working as a university professor of modern arts.
Vietnam Airlines Starts a New Route to Frankfurt, Germany
(Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 8th) - Vietnam Airlines starts a new twice-weekly service to Frankfurt, Germany.  This is the second destination in Europe after Paris and also part of the airline's rapid route expansion strategy.
Vietnam Airlines will use Boeing 767 aircraft and flies from Ho Chi Minh City every Tuesday and Thursday to Frankfurt with stopovers in Hanoi and Moscow.
"We are establishing this route to serve the large number of Vietnamese living in Germany," a spokesman from Vietnam Airlines said.
Vietnam Airlines is currently flying to more than 20 international destinations.  It has inaugurated a number of new routes last year and is poised for further expansion.
Vietnam Airlines announced plans to double its fleet to 70 aircraft by 2010 earlier this week.
Despite the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the war in Iraq, Vietnam Airlines carried 4.05 million passengers in 2003, up one percent.
Vietnam Airlines has set a target of carrying five million passengers this year and it expects about half of them (2.4 million) to be foreigners.
Schools Refuse to Admit HIV Kids: Priest Took Issue to Court
(Agence France-Presse, Nairobi, 7th) - D'Agostino is a candid and outspoken U.S. priest, who runs an AIDS orphanage in Nairobi, capital city of Kenya.  In order to plead on behalf of infected kids, he took the Kenyan government to court in an attempt to compel state-owned schools to revoke their exclusion of HIV-infected children.
Notwithstanding an estimated 2.5 million people are carrying the HIV virus in Kenya, AIDS and HIV are still considered taboo topics in Kenya.
D'Agostino runs the Nyumbani orphanage, which has accepted many HIV-positive children.  He claimed that many children in the orphanage had been refused admission to primary schools.  The approach taken by school management is a violation of the government's policy of obligatory universal primary education.
"Refusal to admit children to public schools, especially those infected by HIV, is inhuman, illegal and a gross violation of human rights.  Education is a fundamental right.  Any refusal is a violation of the rights of these children," D'Agostino's lawyer, Namwamba told the court presided by judge Koome.
D'Agostino is seeking a court order forcing state-owned schools to enroll children irrespective of their HIV status.
Kenyan ministry of education, through its lawyer Gacivih, said it was unaware of the discrimination but such school policy appeared sympathetic.
Gacivih said the ministry of education was willing to discuss the matter with Nyumbani Children's Home, which is situated in the northwestern outskirts of Nairobi.
Judge Koome ordered the two sides to hold discussions today and report the conclusion back to court tomorrow.
U.S. to Release Hundreds of Iraqi Prisoners
(Agence France-Presse, Baghdad) - The chief U.S. administrator in Iraq, Bremer, announced in his policy speech that the U.S.-led coalition will release 100 Iraqi detainees on the 8th and also another several hundreds are to be freed in the next couple of weeks.
Bremer, with the interim Governing Council chairman Pachachi at his side, also unveiled a new offer program, under which any assistance leading to the capture of any of the more wanted criminals may receive a maximum reward of US$200,000.
Pachachi praised the coalition for adopting the aforesaid policy and said that was the result of the Governing Council's lobbying effort.
"The Governing Council has been promoting a peaceful reconciliation amongst all citizens of Iraq for a long time.  In order to achieve this objective, we have demanded the coalition to review the problem of prisoners," Pachachi told reporters.
A coalition spokesman who declined to be named said later that a total of 506 detainees would be released in the next couple of weeks.
"The coalition will release the first batch of 100 detainees tomorrow," Bremer said in his short speech to reporters.
Bremer is making a peace gesture at a time when the coalition strives to comfort and reduce accumulated hatred in Saddam's tribe, the Islamic Sunnites community.
Hussein was captured alive by U.S. troops after fleeing and hiding for eight months.
"As the tyrant is now a prisoner and the majority of his gang are either dead or captured, it is now the time for a reconciliation," Bremer said.
The condition for a release is that the prisoner "must renounce violence" and have a guarantor, such as a prominent person in his community or a religious or tribal leader, who will accept responsibility for the good conduct of the individual being freed.
Bremer pointed out that all prisoners to be freed had never directly involved in any attack on the U.S. army or any other fatal attacks and were never involved in criminal activities or crimes against humanity.
Bremer said those to be released "made a mistake but have now waken up to reality" and "we are prepared to give some of them a chance to make a fresh start".
WHO Experts Went to Guangzhou Again for Causes of SARS
(Agence France-Presse, Guangzhou, 10th) - World Health Organization (WHO) today launched their second investigation this year into the reemergence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) case in southern China.
WHO had earlier conducted an investigation into China's first confirmed case of SARS in six months.
In an attempt to identify the cause of a confirmed and a suspected SARS case, a team of WHO experts and Chinese health authorities conducted a surprised inspection on a local seafood and wildlife restaurant in Guangzhou.
"This trip builds on a review of data we collected in our previous trip ... we will try to put different pieces together," said Wadia, a spokesman for WHO in Guangzhou.
At the same time, the Chinese government is urging the public to eradicate rats and other harmful animals that might carry the SARS virus.
Health officials were targeting the aforesaid Seafood restaurant, a 24-hour eatery in Guangzhou's old city districts, because a 20 year-old waitress there was officially diagnosed as a suspected SARS case on Wednesday evening.
"We have examined very carefully for any environmental problems that might exist in the restaurant and we are going to continue with further investigations," WHO expert Breiman said.
"We have talked with the restaurant staff and learned how things worked in the restaurant.  We then looked at the place where food was prepared and a team of environmental experts will continue with that," Breiman said.
Breiman said it was too early to conclude the cause of the disease, as the team still needed time to analyze information.
U.S. Backs Japan to Build ITER
(Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 10th) - For the first time, United States publicly backed the selection of Japan's Aomori Prefecture rather than the French town of Cadarache as the site for the multi-billion-dollar International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) because it thinks Japan offers a superior site.
The ITER project will choose either the French Cadarache or the Japanese village of Rokkasho in Aomori Prefecture, northern Japan.
The project aims to be a test bed for emulating the sun's nuclear fusion, which is praised as the clean, safe, inexhaustible energy source of the future.
However, the project is not expected to generate electricity before 2050.
During a visit to Tokyo, U.S. Secretary of Energy Abraham told a gathering of Japanese business leaders, "I am proud to say today that the United States strongly supports the building of ITER in Japan.
From a technical standpoint of view, you are offering a superior site".
"The location of Rokkasho village is suitable for receiving the large materials needed for ITER.  Your technical and engineering skills are admired by the world.  In addition, the local community clearly welcomes this project and are trying their best to ensure Rokkasho village is selected," Abraham said.
A spokesman of U.S. embassy in Tokyo confirmed it was the first time that Washington publicly supported the construction of ITER in Japan.
An official from Japan's science and technology ministry said, "We are highly encouraged by Abraham's comment.
We will continue to work with other countries so that we can build ITER in Rokkasho village."
NPA Refused to Talk Peace with Arroyo's Government and Launched a New Wave of Attacks
(Agence France-Presse, Manila, 10th) - Philippines military said eight people have been killed as communist insurgents launched a new wave of attacks, including an attempted raid on a power plant and the burning of a telecommunications tower.
The attacks came as the spokesman of the communist New People's Army (NPA) declared that they would no longer pursue peace talks with the government of President Arroyo but would rather wait for her successor.
"We have no more hope in engaging in peace talks with the government of Arroyo even if she says they are ready to talk," said NPA spokesman Rosal in a television interview.
The Philippines government was planning to hold preliminary talks with NPA later this month towards resuming formal peace negotiations.
Rosal said NPA would like rival presidential candidates running against Arroyo in the May presidential election to make their proposals of how to re-start the peace talks if they are elected.
Rosal said NPA would also demand that they be removed from U.S. and European lists of terrorist groups as a precondition to resume negotiations.
Three soldiers and four NPA guerrillas were killed and seven soldiers wounded after 50 guerrillas attacked a government detachment responsible for defending a power plant in Calaca town.
Iraqi Police and British Soldiers Killed 6 Civilians in a Protest by Unemployed Workers
(Agence France-Presse, Baghdad, 10th) - British soldiers and Iraqi police have shot and killed 6 civilians in a protest at southern Iraq today.
Meanwhile, the Pentagon said Hussein is to be treated as a prisoner of war and he may stand trial within 6 months.
In Baghdad, three loud explosions were heard within an hour but U.S. military said they have not received any relevant information as yet.
Recently, Baghdad suffered from a series of car bomb attacks.  The latest one was on December 31 last year, in which a busy restaurant was blown up causing 8 dead and 24 wounded.
Meanwhile, U.S. military was also launching a major offensive, called "Operation Iron Grip", and commenced shelling on guerilla bases in suburban Baghdad.  U.S. fire can be heard in many parts of the capital from time to time.
In another development, the U.S.-led coalition said today the crash of a U.S. "Black Hawk" helicopter near Falluja last week might be caused by anti-America guerilla attacks.
Nine died in the incident.
According to the coalition, U.S. soldiers have shot and killed two Iraqi policemen by mistake in the highly tensed city of Kirkuk.
Meanwhile, several hundreds of unemployed workers started a protest in the southern city of Amarah.  Finally, Iraq police and British troops opened fire to disperse the crowd and caused 6 dead and 8 wounded.
China Sending Another Delegation to U.S. on a US$2 Billion Purchasing Mission
(Agence France-Presse, Beijing, 12th) - China's state media reported that a Chinese purchasing group is heading for U.S. to sign contracts for the purchase of more than US$2 billion of high tech equipment.
The Beijing Morning Post, citing the words of a Ministry of Information Industry official, said the deals with Motorola, Intel Corp and Cisco Systems Inc etc. would be signed in the United States tomorrow.
The majority of the Chinese companies in the delegation are large telecom firms or computer makers in China, including China Telecom and Legend Group etc.
This is the third Chinese delegation to go on a purchasing mission to the U.S. since last November.
China is trying to reduce its ballooning trade surplus with U.S. and the aforesaid delegation is only part of its efforts.
The Beijing Morning Post said a U.S. Department of Commerce official welcomed the move because it was helpful to reduce U.S. trade deficit with China.
According to figures published by United States, the country had a US$103 billion trade deficit with China in the year before last, which is expected to have soared to US$130 billion in 2003.
Syria Says Israeli President's Invitation to Syrian President Has No Sincerity
(Agence France-Presse, Damascus, 12th) - Israeli President Katsav today invited Syrian President Assad to visit Jerusalem for peace talks.  However, Syrian officials dismissed the offer as "no sincerity" and accused Israeli leaders of trying to sidestep the land-for-peace basis of the Middle East peace process.
"I invite President Assad to come to Jerusalem to seriously negotiate with Israeli leaders the conditions of a peace accord," Katsav said on an Israeli public radio earlier in the day.
"President Assad will be welcomed, but there should be no preconditions," Katsav said.
In an interview by CNN, Syrian Expatriates Minister Shaaban said Israel must declare its willingness to resume negotiations from where they broke off four years ago.
Shaaban said Katsav's invitation is not a "serious response" to Assad's call last month for a revival of contacts with Israel.  He also accused Katsav of seeking a "photo opportunity" with the media.
Syria state-owned news agency SANA quoted the words of an unnamed senior official, who charged Israeli President as trying to evade the land-for-peace basis of the Middle East peace process.
"It is not a question of a visit or who is taking the initiative.  The latest statements by Israel are clearly aimed to avoid the peace process," the official said.
"Part of the solutions and measures could not possibly bring peace to the Middle East area," the official added.
In the previous negotiations with Assad's deceased father, the then Israeli premier Barak agreed to an almost total withdrawal from the Golan Heights, save for a narrow strip of land on the eastern bank of the Sea of Galilee.
However, Damascus rejected the proposal and demanded Israel to return all of the Golan Heights, which Israel occupied in the 1967 war and annexed in 1981.
Growing Friction in the Command Chain of Liberia's Largest Rebel Group
(Agence France-Presse, Monrovia, 12th) - Tension over control of Liberia's largest rebel group, Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), deepened after the ouster of the chairman, Conneh, and a top rebel leader insisted Conneh was still in charge.
The uprising by LURD in 1999 against former president Taylor's regime had sparked a four-year civil war and LURD finally controlled some four-fifths of the country.
Taylor accepted exile in Nigeria in mid-August last year to pave the way for peace in this West African country and the former government, the rebels, and the political opposition formed a transitional government.
However, a group calling itself LURD's "military high command" said a few days ago that they had replaced Conneh with his estranged wife Aisha Keita Conneh, after accusing him of trading LURD's posts in the transitional government for money.
LURD founder Dweh, current speaker of the transitional legislature, insisted that only LURD's national executive council could sack the leader of the organization.
"I founded LURD in Nigeria and I can assure the Liberian people that there is no split in LURD and nothing can derail the peace process," Dweh told the media on the evening before yesterday.
Dweh blamed the split within LURD on behind-the-scenes manipulations by Bryant, leader of the transitional government, and other senior LURD leaders in the transitional government.
Bryant, a businessman, was appointed in October last year to lead the war-battered state to elections in 2005.
Dweh accused Liberia's justice, transport and labor ministers, under the support of Bryant, conspired with Aisha Conneh and promised her the chairmanship of LURD once Conneh was ousted.
He warned that should Bryant continue to violate the peace accord, the warring factions would have to go back to the drawing board in Accra and consider the possibility to replace Bryant.
Former American Boxer Accused a Promotion Company of Bribing Him to Take a Dive
(Agence France-Presse, New York, 12th) - According to a report in New York Daily News, Rose, a former American boxer, said he was offered US$5,000 to lose a fight by officials of Top Rank, a company promoting professional boxing in U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating Top Rank, which is run by Arum.
The 34-year-old Rose said two Top Rank representatives visited him at his home a few weeks prior to his December 1995 fight with fellow American Eric Esch, nicknamed the "Butterbean".
"It was just after noon and I was resting at Home when someone knocked on my door.  I looked out through the peephole and there were two white guys from Top Rank who said they wanted to talk to me about the Butterbean fight," Ross told the newspaper.
"They said, 'We have some money for you, a substantial amount of money.' They hoped I would take a dive in the match. They didn't want me to beat Butterbean."
Rose has spoken to investigators about the 1995 incident as part of a 20-month probe of corruption in American boxing circles.
Rose refused the bribery and knocked the previously unbeaten Eric out in the second round of a fight held at the Madison Square Garden.
New York Daily News rushed to Eric's Alabama residence and asked him whether he believed the words of Ross.  However, Eric defended Top Rank and said, "Rose was not of that caliber.  Why would you ask a boxer with a 1-6 record to take a dive?  I don't believe Top Rank would do anything illegal."
FBI officers raided Top Rank headquarters in Las Vegas on the 6th, seizing financial, medical documents and computers.
The report also said FBI was looking into evidence of fight fixing, including the Mosley-Hoya championship fight in September.
U.S. Hopes Asian Countries Will Leave the Mad Cow Fears Behind
(Agence France-Presse, Manila, 14th) - Despite one mad cow case was reported in U.S. last month, U.S. Agriculture Department officials said Asian countries can feel relieved and continue to consume U.S. beef after a short period of time.
U.S. has immediately stepped up safety testing after the discovery of first mad cow case.  Despite such efforts, several Asian countries, including Japan and South Korea etc., had immediately banned or limited the import of U.S. beef.
U.S. officials said yesterday the relevant authorities have enlarged the investigations of the mad cow disease.  The beef produced in the area where the mad cow disease was found, had never been exported.  In addition, the relevant authorities have been very stringent in testing and quarantine work in the past 10 years to prevent the spread of mad cow disease.
The mad cow disease is also called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and has been linked to the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, which causes vacuolation and spongiform changes in the human brain.
"We are very optimistic that these Asian countries will narrow the scope of bans in next month or so," Graham, director of Asian Affairs, U.S. Agriculture Department said.
"We have guaranteed to all Asian countries that our beef are safe for consumption," Graham said.
He said a Japanese delegation is currently in U.S. to study the measures adopted by U.S. to prevent the spread of mad cow disease.
South Korea Stepped Up Quarantine To Contain Bird Flu
(Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 14th) - South Korean officials said the country has stepped up quarantine efforts to contain the spread of bird flu after a new outbreak of the disease was reported in nine days.
South Korea agriculture ministry said a tight quarantine zone has been established around a chicken farm in Yangsan, 390 kilometers southeast of Seoul.
Health officials have detected the bird flu virus in this area on Monday.
It was South Korea's first confirmed outbreak of bird flu in nine days.
In last month, the highly contagious disease between poultry appeared to have been brought under control after hitting 15 areas nationwide and the authorities slaughtered nearly two million chickens and ducks.
"We have culled all chickens in the affected area and are strictly restricting the movement of poultry," Kim Chang-Seob (transliteration), head of animal health division, South Korea ministry of health said.
The new bird flu case prompted government officials to strengthen quarantine efforts in other areas.
Kim Chang-Seob said the bird flu virus could survive in dust for two weeks and for at least 35 days in excrement.
Summit of the Americas: Bush Barely Keeps the Free Trade Zone Plans
(Agence France-Presse, Monterrey, Mexico, 13th) - U.S. President Bush won a grudging support from 33 other leaders in the Summit of Americas today for the plans to launch an ambitious pan-American free trade zone next year.
However, the Summit of the Americas remained divided on how to combat spreading poverty in the western hemisphere and the United States failed to get an anti-corruption clause included in the final announcement.
The free trade zone, which would stretch from Alaska in the north to Argentina in the south, is entitled the world's largest free trade area, with a market of some 800 million people and a gross domestic product of 13-trillion U.S. dollars.
However, Argentine President Kirchner criticized the U.S. in his speech at the closing of the two-day summit.  He said a Free Trade Area could not possibly solve the problems of the Americas.
Brazil, South America's largest economy, and Venezuela, a key U.S. oil supplier, fought to keep free trade off the summit agenda.  It was only after intense debates that leaders agreed in a declaration to finish negotiating the proposed free trade area of Americas by January 2005.
Iran's Political Struggle Intensifies: Reformists Threaten to Resign from Government
(Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 13th) - Iran's reformists raised the stakes today in their bitter struggle with powerful conservatives over candidacy in the parliamentary election.  Some top cabinet officials threatened to resign unless the conservatives backed down on a move to bar reformers from next month's election.
One of Iran's vice-presidents, Satarifar, warned that the entire government may resign if it is unable to block the attempt by the Guardians Council (of Constitution) to disqualify thousands of candidates from the February 20 parliamentary polls.
"If the government considers itself unable to meet its obligations to protect the rights of citizens and organize free election, then staying in office is not an option," Satarifar said.
All of Iran's 27 provincial governors have also threatened to quit and a source close to President Mohammad Khatami said at least 10 ministers had already prepared letters of resignation.
However, a media report claiming the mild-mannered president himself was ready to step down was denied by his aides.
Disgruntled Reformists' Members of Parliament (MPs) continued their sit-in at the Iranian parliament for the third day and said they were prepared to stay put for weeks.
A total of 83 reformists were disqualified from standing for re-election.
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) said the MPs have already challenged the Guardians Council and urged it to withdraw the rulings.
The 12-member Guardians Council is not an elected supervision authority and has been a bastion of the religious conservative right.
Ms. Ebadi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate loathed by hardliners, said she would later visit the parliament to lend her support to the sit-in MPs and the protest.
Soaring New Zealand Dollar Has Not Weaken Confidence of Businesses
(Agence France-Presse, Wellington, 15th) - New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) said in its latest quarterly report that the soaring New Zealand dollar has brought in some negative impacts but businesses are still confident in New Zealand.
The report said only 2 percent of firms were pessimistic about business conditions over the next six months.  As comparison, the numbers were 3 percent and 20 percent for the preceding two quarters.
The report said there was solid growth in the fourth quarter last year according to different indicators surveyed by the report and 31 percent of firms reported an increase in their own activity over the period.
However, leading indicators suggest the economic growth in New Zealand "may fall mildly in next few quarters".
NZIER economist Gardiner said the New Zealand dollar's rapid appreciation over the last three months had widened the gap between exporters' and non-exporters' confidence.
Eleven percent of exporting firms in the manufacturing and building sectors expected conditions to deteriorate over the next six months while 14 percent of non-exporting firms were optimistic.
The New Zealand dollar has appreciated 30 percent in the past two years.
Resignation of CFO and U.S. Unit Chief Triggered Worries about Adecco
(Agence France-Presse, Zurich, 16th) - Adecco, the world's largest temporary employment agency, said its chief financial officer (CFO) and head of U.S. operations, Weber, had resigned after rumors of an accounting problem in the company.  The exit intensifies the fears of another corporate scandal.
In this week, Weber had just downplayed the significance of the postponement of publishing financial results, which was originally scheduled for February 4.  However, the announcement was delayed when "material weaknesses in internal controls" in Adecco's North American business came to light.¡C
Financial controller Cano will take over Weber's job on an interim basis.
Adecco Staffing chief executive Arrieta has also resigned and will be succeeded by Marcel, chairman of Adecco France, which is the group's largest overseas company in a country.
In addition, former chief executive officer (CEO) Bowmer, who had adopted an advisory role as chairman of the board, will once again take over the helm of the troubled firm, leaving current CEO Caille to "concentrate on managing day-to-day business".
Traders said the unusual changes in top-level personnel once again put Adecco shares under pressure.
By 9:40, Adecco shares had stabilized and slightly rebounded from the massive drop at opening.  However, Adecco was still down 3.6 percent while the Swiss stock market advanced 20.3 points during the same period of time.
Adecco announced on Monday that it will postpone the announcement of financial results for its fiscal year and its shares had since gone into choppy trading.
Japan Targets a Balanced Budget within 10 Years
(Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 16th) - Japan's finance minister Sadakazu Tanigaki said today he was confident the world's second-largest economy would be able to break away from a "fiscal crisis" and put public finances in order within 10 years.
Sadakazu Tanigaki said the combined deficits at central and regional governments amounted to five percent of Japan's total domestic output, which could be eliminated in 10 years if deficits are reduced by 0.5 percent on average every year.
He told a group of journalists, "Japan's fiscal condition remains in a crisis.
Our conditions are the worst among major industrial nations in terms of both (fiscal) flows and reserves."
Tokyo officially set the target of turning "primary deficits" into a "primary surplus" in the year to March 2014 -- the first time in more than two decades that multi-level public finances will be balanced.
This is the first time the government under Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has given a clear target for Japan to regain a "primary surplus".  Under such circumstance, tax revenues will exceed the amount of expenditures excluding debt-servicing costs.
The last time Japan reported such a surplus was in the year to March 1992, which ended a sequence of six years in surplus.
Tokyo Stock Exchange Has Approved Shinsei Bank Listing
(Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 16th) - The Tokyo Stock Exchange said today it has approved an application by Shinsei Bank to list on the exchange, with trading of shares starting from February 19.
U.S. investment fund Ripplewood Holdings took over and restructured the Shinsei Bank prior to making this initial public offering, in which the Bank will offer 242 million shares to domestic investors and an additional 198 million shares to offshore investors.
The offer price will be decided on February 9.
Shinsei Bank has also set aside 36.3 million shares for a possible over-allotment in case some applications might not be able to complete.
Shinsei bank was formerly the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which was put under state control in 1998 after it filed for bankruptcy.  After reorganization, the Bank is now offering retail financial services.
For the year to March 2004, Shinsei Bank group forecast net profit of 65 billion yen (US$613 million), up 22.6 percent over previous year, and a recurring profit of 60 billion yen, up 76.5 percent, on revenue of 175 billion yen, down 13.0 percent.
Shinsei Bank also said it had a total of 132.3 billion yen in non-performing loans as at end of last month, down from 154.2 billion yen three months earlier.
Iran: The Death Toll from the Earthquake in the Historic City of Bam Has Reached 41,000
(Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 16th) - A spokesman for Khamenei, Iran's supreme religious leader, said today the death toll from the earthquake on December 26 last year in the historic city of Bam has reached 41,000 and the final figure could hit 45,000.
Previous estimates had put the death toll at between 30,000 and 35,000.
"At present, the death toll of Bam earthquake has reached 41,000, and there is a possibility that this could increase to 45,000," Mohammadi-Gholpayghani, a director of Khamenei's office, told Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).
"This is a miserable catastrophe," IRNA quoted his words.
Meanwhile, he pledged that the government would accelerate the reconstruction work.
About 30,000 were injured in the Bam earthquake.
A senior provincial official said the reconstruction of Bam would take two years and the government has already invited companies in Iran and outside Iran to submit tenders for reconstruction works.
More than Ten Thousand Marched in Anti-Nuclear Protests in Paris
(Agence France-Presse, Paris, 17th) - Up to 15,000 anti-nuclear protestors marched in Paris and protested against a new generation of reactors.  Protesters also criticized the police of stirring trouble by allowing a separate rally against a ban on religious headscarves in schools.
The main target of these anti-nuclear protestors is the European Pressurized Water Reactor (EPWR), the first of which is to be built in Finland by a consortium including the French state-owned Areva group and German engineering giant Siemens at a cost of three billion euros (US$3.7 billion).
France, which is one of the most nuclear energy-dependent countries in the world, is expected to approve this type of reactors in the near future.  France needs new reactors to start replacing some of the 58 nuclear plants that produce 80 percent of the country's electricity and are nearing the end of service.
"It is in fact a genuine revival of nuclear energy that is unfolding before us," said Lhomme, a spokesman for the group 'End Nuclear Network' which organized the demonstration.
Lhomme criticized the police for allowing another rally.  "We believe the interior ministry is looking for trouble," he said.
The interior ministry in France oversees police works in cities.
The other rally was held almost at the same time at the same spot in Paris and drew thousands to protest government plans to ban Islamic headscarf and other "conspicuous" religious insignia in schools.
Anti-nuclear protesters, who numbered more than 15,000 according to organizers and under 6,000 according to police, built a pyramid of tin cans in the square denouncing what they called the "radioactive waste scandal left for future generations".
Suicide Bomb Killed 23, Wounded 95 in Baghdad
(Agence France-Presse, Baghdad, 18th) - According to U.S. military and Iraqi hospitals, the death toll rose to 23 and the number of wounded to 95 in a suicide car bombing this morning, which blew up the front gate of the U.S. headquarters in Baghdad.
"We have received three dead and 30 wounded," said Doctor Juma at Karrama hospital.
This latest casualty report has raised the dead toll by another three.
A U.S. military spokesman earlier said there were 18 killed and 28 wounded according to a toll compiled at its own military hospitals.  Among those killed, 16 were Iraqis and two were Americans working for the U.S. defense department.
In addition, an emergency room doctor said another two people were reported dead at Baghdad's Yarmuk hospital.
There was no other fatal report at other local hospitals but Yarmuk, al-Kindi and the Neurological Surgical hospital reported a total of 37 wounded.
The aforesaid U.S. military spokesman identified the wounded in U.S. hospitals as 22 Iraqi civilians, four U.S. civilian contractors and two U.S. soldiers.
It was not clear at this time whether the suicide bomber has been counted in the death toll.
Shrinking Workforce Will Impact Economic Output in European Union and Japan
(Agence France-Presse, Davos, Switzerland, 19th) - According to a study by the World Economic Forum and the consultancy firm Watson Wyatt Worldwide (WWW) published today, European Union's (EU's) share of global economic output may reduce to about half of its current level by 2050 as its workforce shrinks.
In contrast, the abundance of workers in developing countries such as India and China should help boost economic growth.
Managing director of WWW, Sammans, said, "Economic output is determined by the growth in labor force and the productivity rates.
In countries with dramatic labor shortages, the supply of goods and services may not meet demands and standards of living."
The study, entitled "Living happily ever after: the economic implications of aging societies", said medical advances have increased life expectancy and the number of people in retirement compared to the number of working-age population is rising (especially in the developed world), which is going to impact directly the economic output.
"Assuming current demographics and economic trends hold, the EU's share of total global output will shrink from 18 percent today to 10 percent in 2050," according to a statement about the study.
"Japan's share would decline from eight percent to four percent," the statement also warned.
Israeli Ambassador to Sweden Damaged an Artwork and Triggered Diplomatic Dispute
(Agence France-Presse, Stockholm, 18th) - Israeli ambassador to Sweden, Mazel, damaged an artwork that commemorates a Palestinian suicide bomber in Sweden's Museum of National Antiquities and triggered a controversy.  Israeli Prime Minister Sharon stepped in today and turned the incident into a full-scale diplomatic row.
Last Friday, ambassador Mazel visited an art exhibition held at Stockholm's Museum of National Antiquities and saw an exhibit showing the photo of the suicide bomber in Haifa last October.  He vandalized the work and was thrown out by the authority.  The incident triggered diplomatic dispute between Israel and Sweden.
Israel has demanded Sweden to dismantle the installation, but its request has been refused.
The incident was widely reported in the Swedish newspapers.
The exhibition is part of an upcoming international conference on genocide hosted by the Swedish government and Israel is also scheduled to participate.
Video footage at the scene showed Mazel put forth his strength in pulling down one of the spotlights and threw it into the water, causing the installation to short-circuit.  Ambassador Mazel was later ordered to leave by the museum director.
Israeli Prime Minister Sharon backed Mazel's actions today and turned the incident into a full-scale diplomatic row.
The exhibit showed a sailboat, entitled "Snow White", navigating at sea with a sail at bow made of a smiling photo of Hanadi Jaradat.
Hanadi was a Palestinian trainee lawyer living in Israel.  She launched a suicide bomb attack in Haifa last October in revenge for her brother, who was killed in an explosion induced by Israeli.  The attack killed 21 Israelis and triggered a new round of conflict between Israel and Palestine.
"I cannot tolerate this kind of artwork.  It is an insult to the families of the victims.  As an ambassador of Israel, I cannot be indifferent to such an obscene distortion of reality," Mazel said.
Democratic Party: Baghdad Blast is Evidence of a Failure of U.S. Policy in Iraq
(Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th) - Democratic presidential candidates seeking to replace Bush in the White House have all pointed out today that the latest massive suicide bombing in Baghdad is evidence of a failure of United States policy in Iraq.
This attack, killing at least 25 people and injuring about 30 people, is the most deadly attack since the beginning of the U.S. occupation.
Bush's Democratic opponents criticized Bush's Iraq policy severely.  Some of the opponents said the attack is the latest proof of a failure in Bush's Iraq policy.
"We have a failed policy right now.  I have no idea why the Administration is not willing to change it," Edwards, Senator of North Carolina told CBS television.
"Obviously, the first thing we need to do is to internationalize the security force in Iraq.  Another thing to do is to hand over the transitional government to the United Nations," He said.
In a public appearance with Democratic presidential candidate Dean, former U.S. President Carter said the U.S.-led Iraq war "has proven to be based on erroneous information and misleading statements" while the latest attack is "a sustained demonstration of tragedy".
Dean has put his election focus on opposing the Iraq war.
Iraqi Insurgents Use Advanced Weapons Against U.S. Helicopters
(Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th) - Senior U.S. army officials said Iraqi rebels are using increasingly sophisticated weapons to attack U.S. helicopters.
Senior Army officials familiar with a classified study told New York Times today that the study found Iraqi guerrillas have used rocket-propelled grenades as well as more advanced heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles to attack U.S. helicopters.
The officials said the study was conducted before the three most recent attacks this month, but those incidents can only reinforce the report's findings.
The study aimed at identifying ways to help pilots evade attacks by Iraqi guerrillas using this kind of weapons but the officials did not elaborate on any new discovery.
Judging from the methodology used in the new wave of attack, it is certainly disturbing because it appears the Iraqi guerrillas have already studied the fighting tactics of U.S. aircrafts carefully.
The research team has found the Iraqi insurgents used an SA-16 shoulder-fired missile in more than one occasion, which is especially worrying.
This type of missile has a sophisticated guidance system that is harder for pilots to thwart.
A senior Army aviator in the Persian Gulf region said, "The enemy enjoys a strategic success each time one of our aircraft is shot down.
It becomes a major media event and the defeat or victory is decided immediately. Therefore, the enemy sees this tactics as very useful."
Since October 25 last year, nine military helicopters have been shot down or have crashed, killing at least 49 U.S. soldiers.
Carter Praised Dean on Eve of Democratic Iowa Caucus
(Agence France-Presse, Plains, Georgia, 18th) - Former U.S. president Carter praised Democratic presidential candidate Dean, a former Vermont governor, for his "courageous and outspoken" opposition to the Iraq war on the eve of the Iowa caucus
"I have been particularly grateful at the courageous and outspoken posture and position that governor Dean has taken from the beginning," Carter told reporters in his hometown, Georgia Plains.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate said, "In the last year and a half, I have spent a lot of time strongly opposing the completely unnecessary and unjust war in Iraq.
Despite my strong efforts, the war commenced and now has proven to be, not only based on erroneous information and misleading statements, but also a sustained demonstration of tragedy."
Carter praised Dean as a strong "advocate of peace".  His statements fell short of a formal endorsement, but U.S. televisions broadcasted Carter's remarks.
As a left-leaning former governor of a northern state, Dean could be at a disadvantageous position when he faces Clark, a retired general and a centrist from Arkansas.  However, Carter's support could boost Dean's chances in the more conservative, religion-conscious southern states.
Carter said in a recent television interview that he saw Dean as the most likely Democratic candidate to go against Bush.
Democrats Criticized Bush for Creating a New Axis of Evil
(Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st) - On the evening of 20th, opposition Democrats accused President Bush of leading the United States into an isolation from the world and creating a new "Axis of Evil" with his policies.
After a replay of the president's State of the Union speech, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, Pelosi, attacked the human and financial costs of last year's Iraq invasion.
The opposition Democrats is being especially hard hitting against Bush because it is another election year (U.S. presidential election will be held in November this year).
Clark, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination, said Bush had created his own "Axis of Evil".
Two years ago, Bush created the term "axis of evil" in his State of the Union speech to describe some countries that were threatening United States.
"That is an axis of fiscal policies that threaten our future; foreign policies that threaten our security and domestic policies that put families dead," Clark said.
U.S. Urged Iran Again to Allow Free and Fair Election
(Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st) - Iran's political crisis deepened as Iran's hard-liners and the reformist government continue to struggle over candidates qualification for the parliamentary election.  U.S. has urged Iran again to allow a free and fair election in February.
"We think it is important that Iran's leadership permits free and fair election through an electoral process that meets international standards.  The Iranian government has to be responsive to the needs of the people," State Department deputy spokesman Ereli said.
"The political situation in Iran is evolving and there are a lot of developments every day.  We are watching the situation carefully," he said.
Ereli made the above comments in response to reporters' questions on the resignations of Iran's ministers and vice presidents.
It was reported that some ministers and vice presidents of Khatami's reformist government have resigned as protests against the banning of a large group of reformist candidates from the parliamentary election to be held on the 20th of next month.
A Small Plane Crashed into a Residential Area in Japan, Killing All 3 People Onboard
(Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 22nd) - A small plane has crashed into a residential area in Yamanashi Prefecture, central Japan, killing all three people on board but "miraculously" missing nearby houses, a kindergarten and a hospital.
An emergency official at the Yamanashi prefectural government, Yamamoto, said the single-engine Cessna 172p, piloted by a young man of 32 years old, crashed into a small parking lot.
One of the passengers, who died in the crash, was a photographer.  He was taking aerial pictures of children lining up to form letters outside a local kindergarten.
The kindergarten is only 100 meters from the crash site.
Yamamoto said, "The small plane crashed right next to houses and a hospital.  All three people on board were killed.
It was a miracle that the plane did not crash into houses or the hospital.
There was strong wind and fuel was leaking.  The plane could have crashed on homes or the hospital.
That would cause a major fire."
An aviation official at the Transport Ministry said the plane took off from Chofu airport in western Tokyo this morning and was scheduled to return there two hours later.
The cause of the accident was not immediately clear.
NASA Has Lost Contact with the Mars Probe, the Spirit
(Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd) - The officials of United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said today NASA has lost contact with the landed "Spirit" because of a serious breakdown in the rover vehicle.
"We have discovered a serious anomaly on the rover vehicle," said Theisinger, officer-in-charge of the Mars exploration rover mission.
NASA said yesterday that thunder and lightning storms over Australia had prevented scientists from sending daily instructions to the Spirit.
However, experts now think a more serious problem has caused the breakdown in communication.
Spirit arrived Mars on January 3 and started searching for signs of life on the red planet last week.
Spirit's twin rover, the "Opportunity", is scheduled to land at nighttime between January 24 and January 25.
The 820 million dollar exploration mission expects the two solar powered rovers to keep working for about three months.
U.S. Optimistic on New Talks with North Korea after Discussions with Japan and South Korea
(Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd) - United States said today it was "very optimistic" that the multi-nation talks, aimed at resolving the North Korea nuclear deadlock, would be resumed soon.  However, U.S. also said the efforts to invite Pyongyang back to the negotiation table had only edged forward.
"We believe it is very likely to have another round of six-party talks before very long.  However, we still do not have a definite date," U.S. top diploma in charge of Asia Pacific Affairs, Kelly said.
Kelly has held talks with senior officials of Japan and South Korea.  They discussed the latest development in the North Korea nuclear problem.  Kelly said the possibility of a second round of talks is still very high.  He was also confident that North Korea would eventually be convinced to scrap its nuclear program.
"We believe it is very likely that the six-party talks can continue," Kelly told reporters.
However, he said any agreement should cover all issues including Pyongyang's guaranty to subject itself to inspection, scraping the enriched uranium program completely, reprocessing of plutonium and treatment of existing nuclear weapons.
North Korea has shown the U.S. non-official delegation the plutonium described by Americans but denied they have any plan for enriched uranium.  North Korea also refuted the U.S. claim that Pyongyang admitted the existence of an enriched uranium plan during the 2002 talks.
WHO Confirmed the 6th Fatal Case of Bird Flu in Vietnam
(Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 24th) - World Health Organization (WHO) today confirmed the sixth fatal case of bird flu in Vietnam: a 13-year-old boy in Ho Chi Minh City has died after contracting the bird flu virus.
This is the first death case due to bird flu in Southern Vietnam.
A Vietnam health official said earlier that the sixth bird flu sufferer has died taking the death toll from the disease in Vietnam to six people.  Obviously, the public is increasingly worried about the spread of the virus to human.
The boy was tested positive for the bird flu virus, H5N1, earlier and hence, became a confirmed death of this disease.
Nguyen The Dung (transliteration), director of Ho Chi Minh City health department told AFP that the boy has passed away at the city's Paediatric Hospital No. 2 on January 22.
The boy was admitted hospital for respiratory ailments on the 19th.
WHO said they are monitoring the situation closely with Vietnam health authorities.
Another Vietnam health official said two sisters also died at a Hanoi hospital on the 22nd because of respiratory illnesses.  Health authorities suspect the two might also be victims of the bird flu.
Bird Flu Infected Millions of Chickens in Indonesia
(Agence France-Presse, Jakarta, 25th) - Indonesia Agriculture Department said today millions of chickens died of bird flu but the disease has not infected any human this far.
Sudarjat, officer in charge at agriculture ministry's animal husbandry department said the public need not panic because the potentially deadly disease has not infected anyone in Indonesia.
There are 7 countries in Asia currently affected by bird flu and 6 people died in Vietnam.
Indonesian officials said earlier the type of avian influenza, which infected the majority of poultry in Java and Bali islands last November, was the Newcastle disease.
This morning, agriculture ministry spokesman Priyono said there was still no sign of a bird flu crisis in Indonesia.
In the evening, he told AFP that it was still not clear whether the outbreak of avian flu was caused by the H5N1 virus.
The H5N1 virus has caused most of the deadly cases in Vietnams.
The spokesman said 4.7 million birds have died since November by a combination of Newcastle disease and Type A avian influenza.
About 60 percent of the birds died from Newcastle disease.
He said the government has not ordered any culling of poultry.
The state-owned Antara news agency quoted the words of Sudarjat and reported that authorities are performing tests using serums from Britain and Australia to determine the strain of the virus involved.  However, the results would only be known on Wednesday or Thursday.  The government would then report to the relevant international organizations.
Traffic in Chaos As Snow blanketed Western and Northern Europe
(Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th) - Snowfall blanketed about half of northern and western Europe triggering traffic and rail chaos as well as cancellation of hundreds of flights in Britain, Germany and Denmark.
In London, Heathrow airport spokesman said accumulation of snow led to cancellation of more than 200 flights last night and a further 80 flights had been dropped this morning.
Accumulated snow had also affected the two other airports close to London, Gatwick and Stansted, with a total of 18 flights cancelled due to the weather.
In Germany, the winter weather led to cancellation of over 60 flights heading for Frankfurt international airport, the country's largest.
Transport Authorities said the remaining several dozens of flights for Frankfurt experienced delays and that the wintry weather was likely to affect air traffic for the rest of the day.
In France, road traffic restrictions went into force in Paris after snowfall last night, but similar measures in other parts of the country were lifted early this morning.
Services at the main Paris airports were reported to be near normal.  Yesterday, Charles de Gaulle Airport reported delays due to a combination of snow and fog.
Nevertheless, the Paris airports authority advised air travelers to check whether their flights were delayed before leaving home.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, most of France was blanketed in snow.

As we can all see, the Consumer Council has made many contributions to protect the rights of consumers over the past 30 years.
If we want to evaluate the achievements of the Consumer Council, the best measure would be a check on any real improvement in consumer rights.
I totally agree with what Chairman Chan has just said -- after 30 years, the consumers not only fully understand their rights now but all walks of life in our community have attached importance to consumer rights.  This is clearly the fruitful result of efforts by Consumer Council and the government.
The Consumer Council conducts regular testing on products and performs market research on products or services.  It also studies the operations of various trades and professions.  The Council publishes fair and objective market information through its monthly magazine, the "Choice".
The public has a lot of faith in the "Choice" monthly magazine and the Council is now working on a web version.  This will enhance the magazine's function and help consumer to acquire more up-to-date market information.
The Council has eleven regional consumer counsel centers and sixteen hotlines, which provide information on goods and services as well as accepting complaints from consumers.
Since the founding of the Consumer Council, it has received an ever-increasing numbers of inquiries - from several thousands cases at the time when it was established in the seventies to the 146,000 cases last year, an increase of twenty folds.  That indicates more and more consumers refer to the Council's reports and opinions before choosing products and services
Furthermore, the Consumer Council has already processed more than 26,000 cases of complaints this year.
The Consumer Council also publishes name of shops that employ improper gimmicks in their business.  This can help consumers to watch out and not to be fooled.  At the same time, it can also caution operators.
Legislator Yeung, I told you before I have watched the television every carefully at the time of July 1.  I have done a lot of introspection thereafter.  I can see citizens have demands, resentment and are not satisfied with the government's policy.
In this area, the government and I have strived to improve over the past six and seven months.  We can see citizens are demanding the government to do a good job with the problems in the economy or people's livelihood and we have made a lot of efforts in these areas.  We also understand our citizens have many opinions against section 23 of the "Basic Law" and therefore, we have withdrawn section 23.  In fact, the government has made an instantaneous response.
As to the demands for democracy in our society, I also understand it clearly.
However, Legislator Yeung, I wish to tell you what I am doing today is to ensure every matter can proceed smoothly after the political review starts.  Therefore, we have to solve some basic problems first and this is a different thing all together.
What are the basic problems?
Some are problems of principle and some are problems in law.  When the relevant rules in the political review involve the "Basic Law", there will be whys and wherefores in interpretation.  Hence, it is necessary to do a good job in this area.
We are doing this part of work and a three-men team has already commenced work.
They will hold counsel with the central government and also listen to everyone's opinion in Hong Kong.  I think this is a good step and is a decision we arrived at after giving serious consideration to opinions in Hong Kong society.
In today's highly competitive commercial environment, brand name plays a crucial function to make products successful.
To create a famous brand name, it is not a task that can be done in one morning or evening.  It needs original design, high quality, thoughtful packaging, effective marketing and sustained investment.
Hong Kong possesses the conditions to create famous brands.
We possess the related know-how, technique and experience.  We have a wealth of talents in everything from design, manufacture and marketing, right up to management.  We also have access to a vast market.
CEPA became effective recently and will further enhance our advantage.  Apart from zero tariffs for exporting goods into mainland market, the best part of it is to stimulate merchants to think more and work hard to increase the value added in our products.  Such that our products can become famous brands adored by consumers in Hong Kong, mainland and even the whole world.
CEPA gives an impetus to Hong Kong products for migrating to the high value added path and, in this sense, the "Hong Kong Top Ten Brand Names Awards" organized by Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong happens to have the same idea by coincidence.
In the past five-year, the Awards have delivered fifty-one "Hong Kong Top Ten Brand Names".
Nevertheless, fifty-one brand names are really nothing in view of the vast market in mainland.  We need to have hundreds, thousands or even more "Hong Kong Top Brand Names".
For many years, Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway Corporation has actively participated in various subway projects in major cities of the mainland and introduced their rich experience gained in Hong Kong to the mainland market in form of professional services.
I am glad to note that the quality of Hong Kong's investment, professional service and management skills are positively accepted in the mainland market.
This type of exchange between Shenzhen and Hong Kong will not only help develop our mother country but also create more development opportunities for Hong Kong merchants.  In addition to the stimulation of the economy, it can help provide more employment opportunities in Hong Kong.
We have to thank the central government and Shenzhen Special Economic Zone government for their policy supports in many areas, without which we cannot possibly reach an agreement in principle for this project.
This is the first investment outside Hong Kong for Mass Transit Railway Corporation.  The participation in mainland subway development in form of an investment can help introduce more Hong Kong brand names to the mainland, which is obviously a delighted event to Hong Kong citizens and compatriots in mainland.
I wish here that the Shenzhen Metro Line 4 would receive a speedy official approval from central government and everything is smooth with the project's engineering work.  This event has laid a stronger foundation for more communication and cooperation between the two places of Shenzhen and Hong Kong in the future.
Today is the fifth day of the lunar new year, I am very glad to be invited by the Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange to join your lunar new year gathering and preside the market reopen ceremony for the new year.
First of all, I wish everyone a happy lunar new year.  May everyone have the spirit of the dragon and the horse.  May time have moved in your favor.  May fortunes find their way to you and may all things that your heart desires come true.
In the past one year, the price of gold surged significantly and has recently broken through the barrier of US$400 an ounce.  The strong trend reflects that investors have regained confidence in gold.
I believe your line of business was very busy in the past year.
In fact, apart from external factors, the flourishing market also reflects the fruit of hard work by the Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange in past 90 years or so.
This endeavor laid a solid foundation stone for Hong Kong's gold market and has made numerous contributions to strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international financial center.
People say "the whole year's work depends on a good start in spring".  I hope the members of Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange will continue with their hard work in the coming year and grasp the "golden" time for the gold and silver industry.  It is also important to grasp the demand on gold trading brought forth by the reform in Mainland gold market, our country's accession to World Trade Organization and CEPA.  I hope everyone can continue to push ahead the development of the market.
I believe with the active promotion by members of the exchange, the gold market in Hong Kong can show an extraordinary splendor in the coming year.
Finally, I wish an active trading in the gold market in the year of the monkey.  All businesses can flourish and thrive.
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
Nevertheless, past challenges are not limited to subsidized public housing.  Private housing is also full of serious ordeals.
The outbreak of 1997 financial crisis has burst the asset bubble, causing property price to fall by 70 percent.  Property owners are hard hit, which was actually the main cause for the accelerated deflation in the past five years.
The economy is turning good now and we are determined to maintain a stable environment to ensure steady development in our property market.
A healthy property market is indeed important to a full recovery in Hong Kong economy.
We are also committed to protect and improve our living environment.
Our work down the road is based on the principle of sustainable development.  We will adopt better city planning and strengthen the protection of natural scenery and cultural relics in order to improve our living environment.
We will double our attention to environmental problems.
In last year, the sudden outbreak of "SARS" reminds us that we must create spacious, clean and healthy living environment.
We have to put in more efforts to beautify our environment -- plant more trees, build more parks and recreation facilities for the enjoyment of our citizens.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank those members of the Legislative Council (LegCo) who expressed their opinions on the different sections of the Chief Executive's "Policy Address", including justice and legal, constitution, civil servants and staff of subsidized organizations, and public security.
As to the justice and legal services area, only legislator Margaret Ng and legislator Tsang Yok-sing have made a statement and they are the chairman and vice chairman of the LegCo Panel on the Administration of Justice and Legal Services.
The Chief Executive has proposed several measures in the "Policy Address" to push ahead people-based governance, including the strengthening of communication between principal officials and the society; conduct more public policy research; strengthen cooperation between the government and LegCo; and finally proceed with a solemn and serious review of the constitutional system.
The Department of Justice will fully participate in the aforesaid works and strives to ensure all government measures conform to laws and procedures, especially the "Basic Law", including the protection of basic rights and freedom to all citizens under the "Basic Law".  At the same time, the Department will maintain its alertness, just as legislator Margaret Ng has said, in order to ensure Hong Kong is ruled by laws and the independence of judiciary system is maintained.
As a principal official, I will strive to understand the opinions of the general public and the legal profession on issues affecting judicial affairs and the legal profession.
For example, the "Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement" (CEPA) is the fruitful result of close cooperation between the government and the profession, including the Bar Association, the Law Society of Hong Kong and the Association of China-Appointed Attesting Officers.
We have successfully included "legal services" in CEPA and rendered the profession an opened service industry in the Mainland.  This will provide a new platform to strengthen the cooperation between legal services in the two places and bring forth macro and long-term benefits to legal services in both places.
The work of the task force is two-way.  We will gather views from the Hong Kong community and reflect them to the Central Government.
Since middle of January this year, we have received more than ten organizations and individuals.
Everyone accepts completely that constitutional development in Hong Kong must conform to "one country, two systems" and Hong Kong is under direct jurisdiction of Central Government.
The majority of them believe the constitutional system in Hong Kong needs improvement.  At the same time, everyone also accepts any development must conform to the "Basic Law".
Some organizations or individuals also have their own opinions on specific procedure or legal issue.
The task force will convey their wishes, views and opinions to the Central Government in entirety.
In the coming month and so, the task force will continue to receive other organizations and individuals.  We will pass on all opinions that we are going to receive to the Central Government.
This is only the first meeting of the task force with the relevant departments of the Central Government.  In future, we still need to follow up and communicate more with the Central Government.
I believe everyone understands that constitutional development involves the relationship between Central Government and the Special Administrative Region.  The Central Government also has the constitutional power and duty to examine and review constitutional development in the Special Administrative Region.  For this, we need to make adequate discussions with the Central Government.
The West Kowloon cultural district is a large scale arts and cultural program never undertaken in Hong Kong.  Its aim is not only to provide arts, culture and entertainment to Hong Kong citizens but also to improve the quality of the city and its citizens.
The West Kowloon cultural district development belongs to the entire Hong Kong society.
The government will continue to explore the idea with all circles in the society such as to draw on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas.
We understand that we are not only seeking tall and magnificent buildings.  We need them to possess the necessary economic benefits, capable of sustained development, and capable of improving citizen's quality of life.
Therefore, the government has attached high importance to the software required by the West Kowloon cultural district to form a matching set.  It is necessary to introduce related policy for facilities management, promotion strategy for cultural programs, contents of performance and exhibition, and propaganda strategy etc. etc.
It is important to listen carefully to "users" opinion during the process of formulating these related policies.
The younger generation -- including every young pal sitting here -- you are going to be one of the major users of West Kowloon cultural district.
We hope that the district can fit the old and the young; can suit both refined and popular tastes.  Irrespective you are a Hong Kong citizen or a foreign tourist and irrespective you are the more mature one or an energetic youth, we hope you can linger in the district with no thought of leaving.
I know that all of you have discussed the different issues of the West Kowloon cultural district this morning.  Some students have also spent a lot of time in the past month and so to compile a special topic report.  I believe all of you are now very familiar with the details of this program.
I am extremely anxious to hear the conclusion of your discussions and look forward to exchange opinions with all of you.
Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, the focus of our world is on security at harbors, airports and borders.
Hong Kong is shipping the highest number of containers to United States.  As the number one port, Hong Kong has swiftly responded to the "Container Security Initiative" brought up by U.S.
Furthermore, we deeply believe that cutting off the lifeline of terrorist organizations can be an effective curb on terrorist activities.
For a long time, the massive inflow and outflow of funds through global financial system has been a nuisance to law enforcement agencies responsible for detection of money laundry and revenues derived from criminal activities.
As a major financial centre in Asia, we believe by cutting off the financial sources of terrorists would be the most effective method to strike out their structure or foundation.
At present, legislative institution in Hong Kong is discussing various recommendations to tighten existing laws to curb any financial assistance to terrorist activities.  Hong Kong is actively matching international standards and situations, for example, the new suggestion to set up a special financial affairs organization to combat money laundry activities, and we may amend our laws.
Furthermore, we are appealing for the set up of more comprehensive information disclosure laws such that related institutions or individuals may report suspicious transactions.
"Balance" is the key for any work in this area -- it is necessary to have sufficient power for effective investigation and at same time, there has to be appropriate constitutional protection for freedom, individual privacy, efficiency in our economic and financial systems.  These are all factors that have to be considered.
Our regulatory measures must be based on law and orders, with high transparency, are fair and effective.
In fact, Hong Kong's service industries have advantages in many areas.
Hong Kong's talents in professional or commercial services have in depth understanding of commercial operations in Mainland and overseas countries.
Hong Kong's professional services in accountancy, finance, law and arbitration will be mainland enterprises' best partners as they become more internationalize and have to align with international markets.
As to our transportation, construction, design and market promotion, management consulting, information technology, convention and exhibition services, they can help improve the overall productivity and competitiveness of mainland enterprises.  They can also help formulate marketing strategy or improve brand images for enterprises and products.
As to tourism, health care and insurance services, they can contribute to promote the development of related market and industries in Mainland and help elevate the service quality.
The close cooperation between service industries in the two places can greatly enhance their respective advantages and assist both sides to face the different types of opportunities and challenges brought forth by globalization.
In order to promote the development of professional services in Mainland market, the Financial Secretary and I, and together with representatives of different professions as well as officials of related policy bureaus and administrative authorities, have started useful and substantive discussions with related departments and equivalent units of the Mainland on the mutual recognition of professional qualification and other topics of concerns to professionals in Beijing last week.
I am very glad that we signed the mutual recognition and cooperation agreement in the three professional areas of architect, structural engineers and insurance.  This is an important step to enable the industries to explore the Mainland market.
Through this meeting, the professional organizations in Hong Kong have established a closer connection with the supervising authorities in Mainland and laid a good foundation for the next phase of friendly cooperation.
I believe the majority of Hong Kong citizens love the mother country and love Hong Kong.
In fact, Hong Kong and Mainland have always maintained close economic, social, political, cultural relation and connections before or after the reunification.  Everything is closely linked to each other.
On the economic front, we saw our nation started the Four Modernizations over twenty years ago and the promotion of reform and opening.  Hong Kong industries had the opportunity to move north and enjoyed a new dimension in development.  This had already tightened the relation between Mainland and Hong Kong society.
Recently, we have another opportunity to finalize the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement with the central government such that different service industries in Hong Kong can enjoy new opportunities; can participate more actively and more broadly in the economic development in Mainland.  Our service industries are now in a position to make useful contribution to our nation and to Hong Kong.  At the same time, this will also tighten the relation between Hong Kong and Mainland.
In social development, we can see our country is making progress at a tremendous pace.
Hong Kong citizens jumped for joy when they knew Beijing's bid for 2008 Olympic games was successful.
A few months ago, Yang Liwei visited Hong Kong and Hong Kong people also jumped for joy, but why?
It is because we feel our country has an achievement that every one of us, every citizen in Hong Kong can be proud of.
I know the Legislative Council started discussions with the government regarding a long-term office location for the Legislative Council ten years ago.
Similarly, the government has been considering a long-term plan to relocate the central government offices for more than ten years.
Therefore, I understand that some members of the Legislative Council will definitely be disappointed by the government's decision to postpone the Tamar development project, which includes the new Legislative Council Complex.
I can understand that it is really great inconveniences for members of the Legislative Council to continue to work in less-than-desired environment during this period of time.
However, just like what I told the colleagues in the government, who are equally affected by this decision, I hope everyone would put public interest as the major premise, understand the situation, and be patient during this period of time.
Earlier, I have already explained several times to the Administrative Management Committee of the Legislative Council -- after consideration of the current financial status of the government and the financial status after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome last year, the government decided it is not the appropriate time to carry out the Tamar project or any other large-scale office-building project.
The government is to postpone the new Legislative Council Complex situated at Tamar site.  This can help reduce the financial strain to the government in the next few years.  It is also in the interest of the public and will be accepted by the public.
The government will re-commence the development project of the Tamar site and the new Legislative Council Complex when the status of public finance improves.  Our existing plan is to do so.
Our nation cares very much about Hong Kong.  The President and the Premier also care very much about Hong Kong.  I know they and the central government will do whatever possible to perfect the job in this area.
So, it does not matter whether it is tourism, finance, infrastructure coordination, aviation rights, zero tariffs on products or service industries, I am sure good news will come one after another.
After a recovery in Hong Kong's economy, I also hope Hong Kong can make better use of its own advantage and make greater contribution to the development of our country.
When I met with Premier Wen Jiabao, I have congratulated him on behalf of Hong Kong for his work in a very difficult year.  Under his leadership, our country has achieved admirable results.  Even though there are still many challenges in the future, you have heard his work report.  He is full of confidence and for that, we are truly inspired.
Premier Wen has also told me to review Mr. Deng Xiaoping's important discussion twenty years ago on "one country, two systems".  It is useful for us to obtain a comprehensive and precise understanding of the guiding principle of "one country, two systems".  This can help our political system development down the road.
He also told me that the people of Hong Kong should grasp this opportunity, concentrate our efforts to better develop the economy and do a good job in improving people's livelihood.  He is confident in Hong Kong.
Later on, I will meet with Mr. Zhang Dejiang, secretary of Guangdong province, and Mr. Huang Huahua, Governor of Guangdong province, and explore with them how to elevate our cooperation to a new level on top of the existing foundation and create a bigger win-win situation.
The last point is "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong people", which becomes all-too-familiar to everyone recently.  This system relies on Hong Kong people, with patriots forming the main body, to manage Hong Kong.
As to patriots, there is also a clear standard.  The criteria for a patriot are to respect one's own nation; a Hong Kong citizen that sincerely support the nation's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong; and not to do any harm to the nation or Hong Kong.  The main body of Hong Kong leadership should be comprised of patriots.
I have to reiterate -- the vast majority of Hong Kong people are patriotic.
We are not talking about the public in general here, but rather those people who participate in management of public affairs in Hong Kong, and those high-ranking individuals within the administrative structure, the Legislative Council and the judiciary.
At the time when they sworn into office in accordance with the "Basic Law", they have made clear their support for the "Basic Law" of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and have pledged loyalty to the People's Republic of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
The five, six principles and important considerations that I just mentioned is a set of long-term policy and guiding principles developed when talks commenced in the eighties on the future of Hong Kong and at the time when the "Joint Declaration" and the "Basic Law" were formulated.  It has not changed and it will not change because it is a series of long-term policy and guiding principles of our nation for the resumption of sovereignty rights over Hong Kong.  It is a state policy and cannot be changed.
Since the intellectual property system was found several hundred years ago, it has fostered the creation of important inventions with epoch-making significance one after the other, especially after the industrial revolution.
In the past twenty years, the intellectual property system has been the basic legal system and important policy measures to promote technology invention in different countries.  The system plays an important role in the stimulation of economy and the strengthening of international competitiveness.
Nowadays, globalization, science and technology are advancing rapidly.  The creation, possession and application of the wealth in knowledge and know-how, together with the number and quality of intellectual property in possession have become important bases for different countries to participate in international competition.
Therefore, we have to strengthen international communication and cooperation in the protection of intellectual property because it has an important meaning in the establishment of a rational and fair new order in international economies as well as the promotion of global economic prosperity and development.
The Chinese government has attached high importance to the protection of intellectual property.
Our country started to establish an intellectual property system at the beginning of the reform and opening.  After over twenty years of endeavor, China has already brought into shape a relative complete legal system for intellectual property.  China has also established an integrated intellectual property protection system comprised of judiciary and law enforcement agencies.  China has done a lot of work in this area in order to make important contribution to promote scientific and technological progress as well as development in our society and economy.
In the twenty-first century, mankind has migrated themselves into an information society.  Technology revolution has propelled productivity advancement in our society with unprecedented momentum in our society.
It is necessary to further improve the intellectual property system in our country and strengthen international communication and cooperation in our work for the protection of intellectual property.  This is a requirement for further opening of our country to foreigners in the new century.  It is also a requirement for the construction of a modernized socialism society and the realization of a grand revival of the Chinese race.
We are willing to go alongside with other countries and build a fair and reasonable intellectual property system that can facilitate technology and economic development in all countries.  We will strive to create a good environment where everyone on earth respects knowledge, admires science and protects intellectual property.
The Shanghai Cooperation Organization's foremost task at this moment is to accelerate the systematic development of its organization.
After the endeavor of various parties, the preparation work for a secretariat and a regional anti-terrorism institution has achieved significant progress.
We need to make untiring efforts to ensure the secretariat can start this year and the regional anti-terrorism institution can be set up at an earlier date.
In order to express our high respect to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and as the host country of the secretariat, the Chinese government has decided to provide the office space for the secretariat free of charge.
From now on, we will continue to provide strong support to ensure the secretariat can commence operations in a smooth way.
One of the important tasks for Shanghai Cooperation Organization is to deepen and expand cooperation in security area.
There are "three stream of forces" seriously endangering the interests of member countries.  We must not lower our alert and can never over-tolerate or accommodate them.
We need to proceed with long-term untiring efforts to eradicate these vicious forces such as to realistically maintain peace and stability in the region.
In order to cut off the capital source that may be used by the "three stream of forces" to finance their activities and also to initiate a more effective, more comprehensive attack on the "three stream of forces", we must include the anti-drug problem into the schedule of security cooperation as soon as possible.
Economic cooperation is the important foundation and a priority for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
Education is the cornerstone of modern civilization.
To improve the quality of our nationals and to strengthen the overall national power, we must put in great efforts to develop education.
Education in rural villages has extensive influence and is affecting the overall economic development in both rural villages and our society.
Since the reform and opening, the appearance of cities and villages in our nation has gone through substantial and profound changes.  This has a close connection with education, especially education in rural villages.
After rural villages implemented the household contract responsibility system, productivity has been greatly enhanced.
We can see that advance and practical technology are in widespread usage in agriculture; township enterprise has suddenly emerged as a new force; and surplus labor in rural areas can migrate in great numbers to coastal regions and cities.  One of the fundamental cause for these phenomena is the solid foundation and support from hundreds of million in the rural labor force that have received the mandatory education.  Universal mandatory education has great accomplishments and its contribution could never be ignored.
At present, the agriculture industry in our country and the rural economy are both situated at a critical juncture of development.  There are urgent needs for all-round quality improvement in the labor force at rural villages because of the migration to high quality, high efficiency, ecology and safe agriculture; expansion in the scale of operations in the agricultural industry; and the transfer of rural surplus labor force.
The technology revolution in the world and our migration towards a full-scale fairly prosperous society have imposed higher demands on the general rural population in terms of their scientific, cultural, ideological and moral quality.
Without the "9-year universal mandatory education", there cannot be any all-round quality improvement for peasants and it would be difficult to realize a fairly prosperous society.
We must fully recognize the function of rural education, including its foundation effect, leading nature and its overall role in the development of a full-scale fairly prosperous society.
Consultants and guests participating in this conference include senior leaders of multinationals, world-renowned economists, experts and scholars with profound attainments.
I can deeply feel the sincere spirit in cooperation and the enthusiastic stand to deal with concrete matters offered by every consultant here.
As we bring our cooperative spirit and collective wisdom into full play, we are not only benefiting the planning and promotion of Guangdong developments but also benefiting our mutual efforts to advance our cooperation and development.
I have been waiting for the arrival of the 2003 International Consulting Meeting on Guangdong such that I can listen and understand your profound knowledge and penetrating insight about the economic and social development in Guangdong.
We are gathering happily here today for a common objective -- enhance cooperation and communication, explore development opportunity such as to add vitality to the economic and social development in Guangdong and, of course, also create opportunity for your career development.
China has joined the World Trade Organization, which symbolizes its migration to a completely new phase of opening to foreigners.  We are participating in international competition on a wider scope, in a wider range of areas and at a higher level.
Guangdong is the province within the Mainland economy that is most opened to foreigners.  It has taken the lead and experienced an unprecedented development opportunities as well as rigorous challenges.
Against such a macro background, we must firmly grasp new opportunities and face new challenges.  It is necessary to raise international competitiveness across the broad and enthusiastically push ahead the modernization process.  We should strive to initiate new prospects of economic cooperation.  We need to complement each other's advantages, pursuit mutual benefits, cooperate on a long-term basis and seek common developments.
The people of Guangdong are concentrating their attention to build a full-scale fairly prosperous society.  Guangdong is accelerating its modernization and this will bring more development opportunities and rooms for every friend.
Guangdong's economy is full of vitality and has a bring future.  It is powerfully poised to stride across another new high.
Iraq's Governing Council has signed an agreement with U.S. occupying forces a few days ago.  They announced a phased timetable for the power transfer to the people of Iraq by June next year.
This agreement has received the reluctant validation by international community -- even though the Foreign Minister of European Union welcomed the agreement, France believe "the process is too slow".  United Nations Secretary General Annan is inspired by the "plan to transfer power" but at the same time, he thinks, "the opportune moment is not ripe yet" for United Nations to play a role in Iraq.  Russia has simply challenged the legality of the agreement.
The people of Iraq are indifferent to the agreement; U.S. public opinions even consider the agreement "a major gamble".
Anyhow, most people are between believing and suspicion.  Most of them are adopting a wait and see attitude.
It is not without reason that international community has so many doubts about it.
People can see that U.S. is not really willing to return sovereignty to people of Iraq.  Therefore, the transfer of political power may not be thorough and it is likely to have a lot of hidden issues.
First, the transitional government scheduled to be formed in May next year is not derived from direct election.  Instead, it is elected by the "Transitional National Assembly", which, in turn, is elected by 18 election committees at provincial level.
Inevitably, people may think U.S. controls the process and its legitimacy might be challenged.
Second, U.S. announced that U.S. troops would not withdraw even after the power transfer.  Effectively, they are just changing from "occupying forces" to "existing forces" only.
U.S. government announced on November 18 its decision to start imposing quotas on three kinds of textile products, namely stockinet, brassiere and gown.
At a time when China strives to expand Sino-U.S. cooperation in economy and trade, U.S. government's protective measure has certainly made everyone felt sorry.
With globalization developed to its current status, it is certainly out of time for U.S. to re-impose quotas on Chinese textile products.
First, such abuse of "quota" restricts the thorough implementation of World Trade Organization's free trade principle.
On one hand, U.S. is talking in high-sounding tone about "free trade".  On the other hand, it re-establishes trade barriers and stabs your back at will with "quotas".  Does it appear too arbitrary and unfair?
Second, "quota" limits the nice growth trend in Sino-America trade relation.
Since China and U.S. reached an agreement for China to join the World Trade Organization in 1999, import from U.S. is increasing at 15 percent a year on average.
In January to September this year, China's import from U.S. has increased 26.2% over corresponding period.
In the past two years, China's import of textile materials and garments from U.S. has increased rapidly.
In fact, U.S. export to China is increasing at the fastest rate amongst all of its trading partners.
Bush's visit to Britain failed to meet his wishes and there are many reasons for that.  The most important one is that U.S. became the sole superpower in the world after the conclusion of the Cold War and it simply turns blind eyes to others as its unilateralism expands.
United States has launched the war against Iraq without United Nations authorization.  It shows no respect for the opinions of its main allies on major international issues including, for example, the Iraq reconstruction.  U.S. persists in its own way and has provoked public anger.
A poll recently released by the Commission of European Union shows 68 percent of the citizens in European Union believe U.S. do not have adequate reasons for its war against Iraq and 53 percent think U.S. constitutes a threat to world peace.
Second, United States emphasizes on anti-terrorism.  It asks its allies to contribute human resources and financial means but it pays no attention to matters that its allies care about.
The United States has grasped Iraq's reconstruction projects tightly in its hand.  The main contracts in the first tender were all given to its own companies and nothing was given to others.  For the dispute over steel, the World Trade Organization has made a ruling that the high U.S. levy is against regulation.  The commerce and industrial sector in Britain hopes that Bush would make some concessions in this trip but in the end, Bush did not clearly declare his stand.
Third, United States regards its concept of value as the highest norm, which overrides concepts of all other countries.  It insists to impose democratic reforms in Middle East countries but has encountered reproaches.  Some allies demanded that United States should respect Iraq's Islamic culture and characteristics.  They believe one of the reasons why U.S. troop was bogged down in quagmire in Iraq is the bitter fruit of "disrespect".
However, Bush would not mend his own ways just because of widespread criticism and opposition.  During his visit, he once again defended his Iraq policy, emphasizing the U.S.-Britain coalition forces would continue to cope with violent events inside Iraq by force.
Since Bush's visit to Britain failed to meet his wishes, the situation in Iraq would not necessarily develop in the direction as the White House wishes.
After lengthy debates over the past six months, an advance detachment of Japan's Self-Defense Forces has departed for Iraq at the end of 2003.
This is the first time that Japan sends soldiers to a foreign battleground since the end of World War II.
It reflects Japan's wish to migrate towards a political and military super power and signifies a change in Japan's defense strategy.
The Self-Defense Forces' trip arouses attention because it is not an isolated incident.
Japan took the opportunity of the Afghanistan war and made a breakthrough deployment of Self-Defense Forces to a foreign country.  Japan used the Korean Peninsula problem and passed the "War Contingency Laws", which foreshadows the use of force or even preemptive attack by Self-Defense Forces.  Recently, Koizumi's cabinet made preparation for troop deployment to Iraq through "The Basic Plan on Reconstruction in Iraq".
One step after another, Japan has finally overcome the restriction of its constitution and succeeded in dispatching soldiers to foreign combat fields.
Furthermore, Japan is preparing to amend its "Concept of Basic Defense Force" in 2004 such as to legalize the deployment of Japanese troops to a foreign country and make that a permanent arrangement.  Japan also intends to send "permanent force", which is not temporarily assembled, to overseas countries.
Meanwhile, the Japanese cabinet has used the so-called "North Korea missile threat" as a reason and decided to commence the deployment of National Missile Defense program from the beginning of 2004.  Japan will import U.S. made "Standard Missile 3" and "Patriot 3" missiles, which can intercept missiles outside and re-entering the earth's atmosphere respectively and thus building a double interception system.
It is not difficult to see Japan's Self-Defense Forces are developing the "combined capability of attack and defense" and the so-called "self-defense forces" specializing in "passive defense" will exist in name only.
Japan's movement has raised concerns because these military policies impact Japan's pacifist constitution.
Koizumi has made a formal visit to the Yasukuni Shrine and he defended his behavior during an interview by reporters.
However, his argument is contradicting and full of loopholes.
Reporters asked Koizumi why he is visiting the shrine.  Koizumi replied, "Japan's peace and prosperity are realized on the foundation of sacrifices in the war.
I am making a formal visit to pray for peace and prosperity in Japan."
We would like to ask: does Koizumi's so-called "sacrifices in war" include class-A war criminals in Word War II like Hideki Tojo etc.?
Can we say that Japan's peace and prosperity after the war are also based on contributions from class-A war criminals?
Some reporters asked why he chose January 1 to visit the Yasukuni Shrine?
Koizumi said a formal visit to a shrine on the first day of a new year is Japan's Confucian orthodoxy.  In fact, many people would pay a formal visit to a shrine on that day.
It is understandable that many ordinary people would like to remember their family members or friends.  In fact, many distressed relatives are making it clear that they are visiting the Yasukuni Shrine in memory of their family members or friends and they strongly oppose any class-A war criminals be enshrined in the Yasukuni Shrine.
The people of China are willing to listen to reasons.  All along, we insist to separate the people of Japan from a small group of militarists.  We need to separate ordinary people from right-wing extremists.  Ordinary citizens visiting the Yasukuni Shrine are not the crux of this history problem.
Unity is strength.
This is an indestructible truth.
In order to realize the grand objective of building a full-scale fairly prosperous society and accomplish the holy undertaking for a great revival of the Chinese people, we must unite all forces available.
In a new century and in a new phase, the work of the patriotic United Front and the People's Political Consultative Conference must use this as the basic start off and stop over points.
We must adhere to and perfect the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system led by the Chinese Communist Party.  We must further strengthen and develop the patriotic United Front.  We must fully mobilize all positive factors on all fronts and add power unceasingly to the great revival of the Chinese people.
In the past one year, the People's Political Consultative Conference has firmly grasped the two main themes of unity and democracy.  It has conscientiously fulfilled its different functions in order to promote a comprehensive development in our economy and our society.  It has played an important role to protect the overall stability of our reform and development.
In the new year, we hope the People's Political Consultative Conference will closely encircle the Party and the center of the country and do an even better job in political consultation, democratic supervision, participation and discussion of politics.  The Conference should enhance the fine points in Confucian orthodoxy, bringing our advantages into play and perform in-depth study and research.  The Conference should actively provide advice and policy suggestion such as to make new and better contribution in the construction of a full-scale fairly prosperous society.
The head of state meeting for the 12th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) was held January 4-6 in Islamabad after a delay for a full year.  The meeting approved several documents, including "South Asian Free Trade Framework Agreement", "Additional Protocol to SAARC on Suppression of Terrorism", "Social Charter for South Asia" etc., and announced that members of SAARC will strive for common development and cooperation in economy, culture and anti-terrorism.
During the SAARC summit, the bilateral meeting of Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee and Pakistani President Musharraf was especially conspicuous.
In the last summit, Vajpayee and Musharraf shook their hands but that did not give people too much hope to the relation development between the two countries.
After two years, tensions between the two countries eased up following a series of important measures including resumption of normal foreign relations, resumption of land and air traffic, and cease-fire in Kashmir region etc.  Finally, the two sides have taken the opportunity in the South Asia summit and realized a meeting at the top.
The two countries have taken another stride forward in the process of improving their bilateral relation, which is a favorable turn for cooperation in South Asia region.
Notwithstanding India's foreign minister Sinha said on the 4th that the meeting was of "ceremonial nature", most people believe the meeting means India and Pakistan relation is heading for a more positive and practical direction.
The leaders of both countries have recognized that tensions and hostility are not in the interests of their nations.  On the other hand, they are missing economic development opportunities time after time.
As globalization intensifies, the urgent tasks of the two governments are to revive their economies and strengthen their cooperation.
Despite official result of the presidential election in Georgia on the 4th has yet to be revealed, it looks the victory of Saakashvili, a candidate jointly supported by right wing parties and the leader of National Movement, is the inevitable outcome.
The Central Election Commission of Georgia said on the 7th that, in the 89% of votes already counted, over 95% of the voters supported Saakashvili.
Some heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States have already sent congratulatory telegrams to this young politician.
Actually, Saakashvili has already proclaimed victory himself as early as the night that the voting ended.
He claimed the result of the polls is a "victory of the people" and said Georgia will take some rapid actions to create its own future.
In interviews by media, many voters said they cast their votes to Saakashvili for the purposes of choosing a "new hope".
Even the former president Shevardnadze, who was forced to resign, expressed support to this political rival of the old days and praised Saakashvili as "young, energetic and well educated".
At the same time of putting hopes on Saakashvili, people also noticed that there were no major changes in Georgia's situation after Shevardnadze's resignation two months ago.
We can say that the newly elected president is still facing the same old problems.
The past year was an important but unusual year in the development process of our country.
We have fought the sudden outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome with extreme hardships and difficulties but we finally achieved a great victory at that stage.  The economy in our country continued to maintain a nice growth trend.  We have climbed another step as the average per capita production surged above 1,000 U.S. dollars.  The "Shenzhou 5" manned space flight was concluded with great success and the Chinese people's dream on space flights has been realized.  Our nationals are untied, the society is progressing and people's livings are better than before.
The achievements of our country in many areas have become the focus of world attention.  Everyone in the country has contributed tremendous efforts and is showing courage and strength to create miracle.  No one is scared of hardships or dangers.
Looking into the new year, we are full of confidence and wishes.
Judging from the overall domestic and international situations, our country is situated at an important strategic opportunity period that we must tightly grasp and make maximum use of it.
We have to adhere to Deng Xiaoping's theories and the important guiding thoughts of "Three Represents".  We have to thoroughly put into effect the spirit of the 16th CPC National Congress and the 16th Communist Party Congress.  We must conscientiously implement the major policies and overall plans of the central government for this year.  We must continue to push ahead reform, opening, modernization and development.
In order to do this year's job properly, we must correctly grasp the circumstances.  It is necessary to visualize favorable conditions, new opportunities as well as unfavorable conditions and new challenges.  We have to increase our sense of responsibility, our sense of urgency and our sense of concern.
A three-party meeting on the Iraq problem was held in United Nations' New York headquarters on the 19th and Annan, the Secretary General of United Nation (UN), exchanged views with representatives from Iraq's Governing Council and U.S.-Britain Coalition Provisional Authority.  Their discussions focused on how UN can play a role in Iraq's reconstruction.
The three sides have exchanged views candidly and the discussion involved politics, humanity and security issues in Iraq as well as the appointment of a special UN representative to be stationed in Iraq.
U.S.-Britain is at a critical juncture where their plan to transfer power in Iraq might be boycotted.  As a result, people are watching attentively whether and how UN may involve in the reconstruction of Iraq.
Since U.S. announced that the main war in Iraq has ended in early May last year, the situation in Iraq continues to be unstable.  Attacks came one after the other as protests against the occupation and are causing countless casualties to the U.S.-Britain Coalition.  There is hardly any peaceful day.
The former president of Iraq, Saddem Hussein, was captured on December 13 last year but the joy in U.S. failed to endure.  The security situation in Iraq has not improved.  Resistance activities have intensified and are pushing the occupying forces into a difficulty position.
On the other hand, the people of Iraq and Arab countries have unanimously demanded foreign troops to leave and return sovereignty to Iraq, thus allowing the people of Iraq to manage their own country.
Meanwhile, U.S. and Britain are making every effort to re-mold the Iraq regime according to their wishes because on such a foundation, they can gradually extricate themselves from this quagmire "in an elegant way".
For this purpose, the process and the model of power transfer have become the focus of Iraq affairs at this time.
The tentative plan brought up by U.S.-Britain Provisional Authority and Iraq's Governing Council in November last year is: a transitional government is to be formed before July 1 this year through an election in the "Transitional National Assembly" but "provincial election committee" nominates the representatives to attend the Assembly.
Iraq's Shiite, which accounts for the majority of the population, stressed that a nationwide direct election is the fair way to return sovereignty to Iraq.
U.S. Secretary of State Powell's visit to Russia is still a conspicuous focal point of public opinions.
This is because of decisive roles played by U.S. and Russia.  Their relation may have a profound impact to the modern world.
More important, Powell's Moscow trip is full of practical contents and has transmitted a clear signal -- as far as Russia-U.S. relation is concerned, there is a dark cloud over the sky.
If this dark cloud is not promptly dissipated, the future relation of two countries may turn dim.
Despite the channel for dialogue between Washington and Moscow is clear, Powell has decided to clarify his position through an article in Russia's influential newspaper, the "Izvestia".
Powell said in the article that U.S. is confused by a series of events in Russia's internal affairs and foreign affairs over the past few months.
He is of the opinion that the Russian administration is not totally accepting the restrains of legal system and its position in certain crucial factors of a democratic society is not firm, including freedom of information and political party development.
U.S. is especially disturbed by Russia's policy in Chechen and its attitude towards the neighboring Commonwealth of the Independent States.
To diplomats, the use of public media to declare one's stand is considered the "last mode" of communication.
The original intention for U.S. to make such a choice is pregnant with meaning but the embarrassment and dissatisfaction on the Russia side is obvious to everyone.
As we entered the new century, globalization becomes an important and rigorous challenge facing African countries.
The leaders of African countries understand more and more clearly that Africa cannot let slip a good opportunity and should rise with spirit to found counter measures.
On July 9, 2002, the African Union was formed and has commenced operations.  Since then, on one hand, African countries have been actively promoting the "New Partnership for African Development".  They endeavor to develop their economies and strive to break away from an unfavorable position in globalization.  On the other hand, African countries are exerting great efforts to remove any man-made barriers to the grand mission of an Africa revival -- the armed conflict problem, such as to create a united, peaceful and stable environment.
At present, the overall situation in Africa is easing up and hot issues are cooling down.  Different nations are feeling the sense of urgency to end the armed conflict.
With the strong support from United Nations and international community, influential regional institutions in Africa, big countries in the regions and even famous politicians are all taking active actions to step up efforts to resolve regional conflict and internal turmoil.  As a result, some prolonged conflict and instability are basically under control.
For example, the Democratic Republic Of Congo has formed a national reconciliation government in June last year.  The Republic of Sao Tome and Principe has resolved its coup crisis peacefully in July last year.  The government of Liberia has signed a peace accord with the armed rebels in Accra, capital of Ghana, in August last year.  The Sudan government has held a crucial meeting with the southern-armed rebels in September last year, which was a breakthrough of the deadlock in the peace process.  In October, the different armed and political groups in Somali have held peace talks in Kenya to discuss a nationwide peace process.  In November, Burundi government has signed a peace accord with anti-government rebels.
Naturally, stability in the African region is still relatively fragile and the peace fruit still requires further strengthening.  Some potential or actual armed conflicts are still awaiting a final resolution.
Meanwhile, the pace of economic development in African countries is still showing a huge gap with that in developing countries in Asia.  This is obviously an unfavorable factor for development in Africa.
It obviously requires long-term and arduous efforts from the people of Africa before African countries can effectively deal with the challenges of globalization and realize the dream of an Africa revival.
Recently, there are outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza one after another in some regions of our country.
Party's Central Committee (PCC) and Government Administration Council (GAC) have attached high importance to this.  They swiftly made a series of important decisions and brought up clear, definite guiding principles, measures and policy for prevention and control.
Related local authorities and departments have taken urgent actions and, in accordance with PCC and GAC deployment, are sparing no efforts to stop the epidemic disease from spreading.
At present, intense prevention and control work are proceeding in a systematic manner across the nation to combat the avian flu.
The highly pathogenic avian flu is a type of animal epidemic disease that can spread rapidly and causes great harm to animals.  The disease may seriously endanger the production in livestock industry as well as the health and safety of the public.
It is important to perfect the work in prevention and control of the highly pathogenic avian flu because it affects public health and safety; affects the development of agriculture and farmers' income; affects overall economic development; and affects the stability of our society.  All regions and departments should be guided by the important thought of "Three Represents" and operate in accordance with the requirement of the "Animal Epidemic Prevention Law of the Peoples' Republic of China".  All regions and departments should strengthen their leadership, operate in close coordination, base on scientific knowledge and in accordance with law, including group prevention and group control.  Authorities should be decisive in actions in order to be highly responsible to the public.  Officials must conscientiously implement the different prevention and control measures.  Every one must have the determination to win this blocking action of avian flu.
As the largest debtor country in the world, United States' foreign debt is on the rise again.
U.S. Treasury Department announced on January 16 that the country owes a total of 6.494 trillion U.S. dollars to all kinds of foreign creditors, 2.2 percent higher than the previous announcement.
On average, every American shares a debt of over twenty thousand U.S. dollars.
As a coincidence, International Monetary Fund released a research report just a week earlier, which sounded the warning bell, in a sharp and systematically way, against America's faltering financial base.  The report pointed out the country's external debt, which keeps on hitting new records, has grown to an extent that threatens the global financial stability.
Statistics show that foreign private investors are holding some 40 percent of all U.S. government bonds.
This reminds us the idea presented by Keynes to President Roosevelt in the first half of the 20th century -- adopt a deficit policy to stimulate economy at home and borrow money from other countries to make up for the shortfall.
The measure did play an important role to stimulate "effective demand" and could ease a financial crisis as pressing as a fire singeing one's eyebrows.
However, people can see many American administrations followed the same measure and taken it as a "miraculous cure".
Since President Reagan called for tax cut and arms expansion in the eighties of the twentieth century, U.S. fiscal deficits are increasing gradually and eventually turned U.S. into the biggest debtor nation.
The convention of the first round six-party talks was an important step forward for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear problem in Korean Peninsula through dialogue.
In the first round of talks, the different sides have come to some common points.  The meeting laid down the necessary foundation for future talks and also further clarified the objective, route and guiding principle to resolve the nuclear problem in Korean Peninsula.
In the past several months, the relevant sides have all insisted to resolve the nuclear problem in Korean Peninsula peacefully through dialogue.  Based on the foundation of the results of first round of talks, different sides have proceeded with a wide range of coordination and discussions at different levels such as to contribute untiring efforts to hold the second round meeting at an earlier date.
Meanwhile, North Korea and U.S. have also shown more flexibility at various levels.
Right now, the preparation work for more talks have achieved important progress and a good meeting is what everybody wants.
The relevant sides and the international community are all following with interest on issues like what kind of results can be achieved in the second round talks, or whether the peace process can continue.
For this, a spokesman of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the objective of the six-party talks is to maintain dialogue and push ahead the peace process.  China is willing to work jointly with other parties on this objective.
China's starting point is to maintain peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and realize denuclearization in the Peninsula.
China believes if all parties to the meeting maintain their sincerity, respect each other, and consult each other on the basis of equality, then that would create favorable conditions for the resolution of the related problem.
U.S.-Libya relation deteriorated at the end of seventies in the last century and the two countries terminated diplomatic relation in 1981.
U.S. President Reagan has drawn up a list of accusations against the Libyan leader Qadhafi including secret development of nuclear weapons, military interference in foreign countries and terrorism etc.
The quarrel between the two sides had finally turned into warfare.  U.S. launched two surgical-type air raids on Libya, code-named "Operation Prairie Fire" and "Operation El Dorado Canyon".
Thereafter, U.S. imposed economic sanction on Libya and attacked Libya on the political front, suppressed it in foreign affairs and continued to threaten the country militarily.
However, Qadhafi did not give in under the heavy pressure.
At present, U.S.-Libya relation has improved.  Some people have given credit to the effect of the Iraq war, which terrorize others by military force, but that might be a biased judgment.
In fact, for many years, the peculiar character Qadhafi has been contending U.S. on one hand but on the other hand, he was also throwing branches of the olive tree towards U.S.  Regrettably, Libya has not received any response from U.S.
After the Iraq war ended, the different sides in Middle East have adjusted their strategy.  The redistribution of power in the region has provided a turning point for the resumption of diplomatic relation between U.S. and Libya.
To Qadhafi, the cultivation of friendship with U.S. can terminate the economic sanction.  Libya can then develop vigorously its economy, improves the living of its people, breaks away from isolation and blends into international community.
By giving up something that Libya has never achieved and cannot achieve in a short time, Libya can migrate into a new environment and no wonder people sometimes say, "Past the dark willows and flowers in bloom lies another village".
In February 7 - 8, important political figures from Europe, U.S. and other regions in the world gathered in Munich of Germany to attend the 44th Munich Conference on Security Policy.
The so-called "Munich Conference on Security Policy" is a forum for international security issues organized by a non-governmental institution in Germany but sponsored by the German government.  In recent years and especially after "September 11", more and more people are starting to attach importance to the event and it is praised as "Davos Forum" for security.
One of the important topics for discussion in this meeting is the cross Atlantic relation.
Judging from the words of political figures during meetings and off meetings, both sides are trying hard to get rid of the shadows to their relation cast by the Iraq war and strive to return to the path of cooperation.
Bertram, head of Berlin's Institute for International Politics and Security, said that the meeting is an occasion for U.S. and Europe to repair their relation and both sides are showing desire to line up again with each other.
For Europe-U.S. relation, the new message from the meeting is that Europe and U.S. need some new dialogue.  They have to seriously consider the common mission faced by them and identify the convergent point of interests in fulfilling these missions.
In contrast to the meeting last year, this year is not explosive at all and the stands of both sides are close.
The "old Europe" represented by France and Germany are still deeply concerned at heart about the U.S. war against Iraq but indicated the necessity to "look ahead".
German foreign minister Fischer said in the meeting, "Despite our view on the war is different, we still need to jointly ensure Iraq has peace after the war and for this, we must look ahead".
He further said Germany will not send soldiers to Iraq but Germany does not intend to block NATO from playing a direct role in Iraq.
U.S. has grabbed the early opportunities in modern mass media and monopolizes the rights to speak in a fairly large portion of international news.  Its public opinions and propaganda are reaching out to the whole world; virtually to a level that it can get in by every opening.  And now, why does U.S. bother to put in huge sums to set up a special satellite television station to cover the 22 countries in Middle East?
To use the words of the person in charge at "The Free One" television, U.S. is trying to provide Arabian countries with a news platform featuring "fair and all-round viewpoint".
Nevertheless, analysts pointed out that "The Free One" is U.S. strategic weapon to permeate into public opinions of Arabian countries.  It is a cultural invasion and a psychological attack plan.  It is U.S. propaganda machine to help push ahead the integration in Middle East and an attempt to reform the policy in Islamic world.
Judging from this, "The Free One" has unusual missions.  If we select the most important ones, there are roughly three of them: first, to broadcast the "free concept".
U.S. believes the Islamic civilization is a serious obstruction to the promotion of modern civilization by western world.  The extreme religious forces in Islamic countries in Middle East are breeding grounds for international terrorism with an anti-America characteristic.  It is necessary to reform the Islamic world in order for anti-terrorism to be effective.  It is necessary to make the Islamic world recognize and accept western values, living style and political systems.
U.S. is attempting to change and influence Arabians unobtrusively and imperceptibly by inculcating its ideology through programs on "The Free One".
Second, to improve the image of United States.
U.S. is adopting unilateralism in its foreign affairs.  In a series of international issues, U.S. has been inordinately proud of its strength and persists in its own way.   Its high-handed actions have caused resentment and complaints from Arabian countries and the Islamic world.
Since the "September 11" incident, America's consistent undue favor for Israel has intensified its contradiction with the Islamic world in Middle East.
U.S. has used anti-terrorism and elimination of mass destruction weapon as an excuse and invaded Iraq without any concrete evidence or authorization from United Nations.  Its act has provoked strong resentment from the Muslim public.
The peace hope in South Asia subcontinent has risen again as Pakistani and Indian officials held talks on February 16 - 18 in Islamabad.
The officials of the two countries have established the mechanism for continued dialogue down the road, including a confirmed schedule and model of the talks.  This symbolizes the restart of the dialogue process between Pakistan and India after an interruption of two years and has paved a foundation for the two countries to sort out gradually all the questions hanging in the air, including the Kashmir dispute.  It is also a realization of their precious sincerity for peace.
Before this talk, many analysts are still very conservative about the future of the peace process, despite a series of good intentions exhibited by both sides have already warmed up their relation.
This is not to be blamed given the rapid ups and downs in Pakistan-India relation over the past few years.  It looks as if no one dares to guarantee anything -- the sunshine illuminates on the negotiation table today may turn into thunder and lightning at the border tomorrow.
Nevertheless, when Pakistan Foreign Secretary Riaz Khokhar read out the joint statement of the two nations with a smiling face on the 18th, optimistic feelings are permeating for another time.  Suddenly, a new light shines into the eyes of those who have been watching the South Asia situation for a long period of time.
First, the timetable agreed in the meeting is feasible and both sides have not only confirmed the specific schedule and topics for meeting but also assigned levels to different talks in accordance with the importance of the topic involved.
Second, both sides have learned from the failure in the Agra summit back in July 2001, in which direct dialogue between leaders of the two countries had led to a total failure of the meeting.  This time, the dialogue will use a "step-by-step" model.  Talks will start from a low level and gradually move to higher levels such as to make sufficient preparation for dialogue at senior level.
In addition, after the several ups and downs in bilateral relation between the two countries, both sides are now in unanimity that war is not a good solution for problems and one should better stay away from it.  This common consensus has laid a foundation for the leaders of the two countries to reach an understanding of "no more war between Pakistan and India" some time in the future.
In order to understand precisely and carry through the guiding principle of "one country, two systems", it is necessary to link "one country" to "two systems" and "patriotic to nation" with "patriotic to Hong Kong".  The admiration for a highly autonomous Hong Kong has to be linked to the maintenance of sovereignty in our country.  The continuation of capitalism in Hong Kong has also to be linked to the socialism advocated by our country.
It is only then can Hong Kong compatriots' wellbeing be realistically protected and everything conforms to the long-term interests of our nation and its people.
Since the reunification of Hong Kong, the central government is determined to adhere to the guiding principle of "one country, two systems" and has handled all affairs strictly according to the Basic Law.
The vast majority of compatriots in Hong Kong are enjoying unprecedented democratic rights in the position as a host.
With the strong support from central government and the motherland, Hong Kong has overcome various risks and challenges, including the impacts of the Asian financial crisis.  Hong Kong continues to maintain its position as an international finance, trade and shipping center.
The guiding principle of "one country, two systems" has proven to have strong vitality after its implementation in real life.
Today, the re-publication of comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech twenty years ago has shown to everyone in the world the strong determination of the central government to implement and adhere to the guiding principle of "one country, two systems".  Furthermore, it is also for the purpose of enabling everyone to understand precisely the guidance of "one country, two systems" such as to push ahead the grand implementation of "one country, two systems".
Today, the Central Committee of the CPC and the State Council are solemnly convening the State Science and Technological Award Convention here.
President Hu Jintao will confer the 2003 State Preeminent Science and Technological Award to two academicians, Liu Dongsheng and Wang Yongzhi.
This convention will also award the National Science and Technology Awards (Top Grade) for "China's manned space project", the 2003 National Award for Natural Sciences, National Award for Technological Invention, and National Award for Science and Technology Progress to their awardees.
On behalf of the Central Committee of the CPC and the State Council, I would like to express enthusiastic congratulations to all awardees.
I also wish to extend my sincere regards and esteemed respects to all technology personnel on all front lines across our nation.
The first 20 years of this century is an important strategic opportunity period for our nation.  We must tightly grasp it and make maximum use of it.
We should gather all forces and construct a full-scale fairly prosperous society at a higher level that benefits our population of over 1 billion.
We should make best use of this strategic opportunity period and strive for some accomplishments.  We must put development of science and technology at a more notable position and attach more importance to it.
Since the "September 11" incident, U.S. President Bush has introduced the "preemptive strike" policy in June 2002.  The policy was applied in U.S. foreign affairs and the first "preemptive strike" war took place in March last year against Iraq.
The concept of "preemptive strike" directly contradicts the core principle of "respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other" in international law.  Moreover, it has the danger that others may copy and follow this principle and thus causing new instability in international order.
When the theory of "preemptive strike" first came out, some important political figures in U.S. had already raised this question, "What should we do if other countries gradually follow our way?"
Unfortunately just as predicted, more and more countries are saying they would "strike first" in the past two years and the "preemptive strike" team gets bigger and bigger.
This is obviously a new trend worthwhile attention and study.
In the same month as Bush brought out the "strike first" strategy, Australian Prime Minister Howard was the first one to stand out and expressed support.
He said once Australia has obtained reliable information about terrorist attack on the country, it will adopt the "strike first" strategy and is not hesitate to initiate military actions against nearby countries.
He even proposes to amend the charter of Union Nations such that the "strike first" principle can be written in the charter giving nations the right to "strike first".  He thinks this is necessary for the suppression of terrorists or the suppression of countries that support terrorist activities.
In northeastern Asia, Japan Defense Agency also released a "Defense White Paper" in July 1999 proposing that Japan may attack foreign bases under the "strike first" principle when it faces possible missile attack or on the verge of being invaded militarily.
Since the Iraq war, it is widely reported that Japan is stepping up its call for "strike first" strategy.
Recently, a lot of international public opinions commented on U.S. current policy on Africa.
An article entitled the "Africa Policy Outlook 2004", published in the January 2004 issue of "Foreign Policy in Focus" in U.S., believe the foreign policy of Bush administration has brought forth negative impacts directly and indirectly to Africa.  U.S. continues to fully focus on the war against terrorism and the problem of proliferation in weapon of mass destruction.  In particular, U.S. is tied up in Iraq and cannot afford to give too much attention to Africa.
Many of us still recall the Bush administration has established the "President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief" in January last year to express care for Africa and undertook to provide a minimum of US$3 billion a year to Africa.
In July last year, Bush visited the five African countries of Senegal, South Africa, Botswana, Uganda and Nigeria and has promised various assistance to Africa, including US$15 billion for the prevention and control of AIDS, another US$100 million to combat terrorist activities in Africa, emergency food relief and education assistance program etc.
These assistance programs were once welcomed by African countries and won numerous praises from international community.
Nevertheless, U.S. has not proceeded with any specific implementation in the past one-year.
But, Africa is in urgent needs.
After we moved into the new century, Africa is facing numerous challenges in its development.  The "African Union" was formed to coordinate the affairs of the whole continent such as to achieve the "Development Objective for 21st Century" devised by United Nations in 2000, which calls for reduction in hunger, poverty and to promote health care and education.  The "New Partnership for African Development" was also laid down to promote development in nations but development capital funds are in serious shortage because of the fragile economic base.
The United Nations have urged many times for developed countries to use 0.7% of their gross domestic products as official aids to least developed countries.
Yet, U.S. official aids are only 0.1% of its gross domestic products, which is quite different from the United Nations' request and putting it in the last position on the donor country list.
Recently, the public opinions in Europe are exploring a popular topic -- is the meeting of the "three magnates", German chancellor Schroeder, French President Chirac and British Prime Minister Blair, gradually becomes some kind of mechanism?
Public opinions called the "three magnates" the "three new carts" of European Union and the relation between the three countries as the "new triangle".
The "new triangle" is a new thing and what course it is going to take remains to be seen.  However, no matter judging from any angle, the "new triangle" appears to have an overall benefit to the process of uniting Europe.  Hence, it may benefit Europe to be a pole in the world's multi-polarization pattern and also for Europe to play a more important role in the international stage.
A review of European history for the past hundred years tells us a fundamental characteristic of the triangular relation between Germany, France and Britain: the alliance of Britain and France to restrict or resist Germany.
The two World Wars are the proof.
During the Cold War, East and West Germany were separated as a member in the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization respectively.
After the Cold War, the united Germany became much stronger than before and caused an imbalance of power in Western Europe.  France became suspicious and for a certain time, the "Germany-France axle" ceased to rotate.  This caused France to move closer to Britain with an intention to contain Germany.
In recent years, the "Germany-France axle" has fired up again but the drastic clashes between unilateralism and multi-polarization in the world has pushed European Union into a serious spilt on the Iraq issue:
The "old Europe" led by Germany, France and the "new Europe" led by Britain, Poland adopted totally opposite stands in the Iraq war problem.
It also happened that the spilt occurred at a time when the European Union was about to proceed with the biggest enlargement in history.
Egyptian president Mubarak made a speech on the issue of reform in Arabian countries a few days ago in Cairo.  He criticized the external world for imposing a single reform model to Arabian countries.  He warned that such attempt may have an exactly opposite effect and is not beneficial to peace and stability in the Middle East region.
He believed reform measures have to be based on distinguishing features in a country and countries should proceed with reforms according to their own capabilities.  A single reform model ignores cultural background, social customs and religious characteristic in different countries.
He also pointed out that Arabian countries welcome external help in their reform processes.  However, such efforts must clearly recognize different national conditions and respect the wishes of different countries before such efforts can effectively push ahead the reform processes in Arabian countries encompassing politics, economy and culture etc.
The words of the Egyptian leader represent the common view of Arabian countries.
At present, Middle East is one of the hot spots in the world under the pressure of anti-terrorism, anti-proliferation and democratic reform.  It is brewing new unrest and may lead to new integration.
After two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, how should political reconstruction be carried out in Iraq, the former "axis of evil" to America?
What will the changes be in the different system of government and the social model in the Middle East region?
This is not only a concern to the Arab world and international community.  In fact, the United States and its western allies may also be interested in it.
After a meeting with the visiting Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain on the 9th in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Powell reiterated U.S. plan to promote "western democracy and capitalism" in Iraq and the Middle East.
He further stressed that, "We are contemplating what else can be done and how we can turn all these into systems."
The International Olympics Committee designated last year as the "Year of Education and Culture".
Making use of this opportune time, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games held a series of educational activities to promote advance literacy and popularized the knowledge about the Olympic games.
Among these activities, the publication of a textbook targeted at young readers, entitled "Learn More About the Olympic Games for High School Students", is an important achievement.
The textbook is excellent in both pictures and literary compositions.  It employs the story-telling approach to make lively and systematic introductions about the Olympic games and the essence of its spirit.  It is a good educational material to strengthen young students' knowledge about the Olympic games and also help raise the enthusiasm of our society to take part in the Olympic games.
Last year, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games has also specially designed a timetable for young students, which was made by recycled papers with the Beijing Olympic logo imprinted on it.
The theme of "Green Olympics" is to prepare and host the Olympic games in accordance with sustainable development concepts, including environmental protection and ecological balance.
Just like setting time for lessons, we hope that the timetable can set a standard to the behavior of young students and gradually render them a supporter and promoter of "Green Olympics".
Education is a core content of the Olympic games and an important reflection of the "people's Olympics".
The real objective of the Olympic games is to promote, from a new angle and using a new style of education, the harmonious development of body and mind of young people such as to make a contribution in the construction of a nice and peaceful world.
Hence, the combination of sports and education not only opens a new area for education, but also enhance the significance of Olympic games in education.
"Green Olympics" is one of the three themes for the 2008 Olympics to be hosted in Beijing.
The core content is to greatly improve the quality of the environment in our capital -- create a graceful environment for the Olympic games and build an ecological city.
To achieve this end, Beijing has to adopt a wide range of technology and measures to protect the environment.  It is necessary to promote large-scale environmental treatment in every way, including forestation in city and rural areas; development of environmental protection industries; enhance conscious of the society in environmental protection; and encourage active public participation in different activities to improve the ecological environment.
It is important to do a good job in the implementation of "Green Olympics" in order to push ahead an all-round, coordinated and sustainable development in Beijing's economy and society.  This carries through the assertion in the 16th Communist Party Congress for the establishment of a people-oriented, all-round, coordinated and sustainable scientific development.
We must attach high importance to this.
In order to realize the green Olympics objective, the Beijing City has already compiled "Beijing Olympics Action Plan" and "Ecology and Pollution Control Plan" on top of the foundation of its "Fifteen Plan" and "Olympics Bid Report".  These plans set out the new objectives and plans for environmental development and protection work in the next few years.
Through systematic and step-by-step implementation, Beijing will accomplish the objective of organizing a green Olympics.
On February 25, U.S. State Department released the "2003 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices", which, once again, made frivolous remarks about human right situations in over 190 countries and regions, including China.  The tone of the report is just like your "grandfather's teacher" and says the human right conditions in many countries are no good, in a mess or did not conform to U.S. standard.  Some other countries are moving backward in crucial areas in human rights etc.
Naturally, there are also countries with great improvements in human rights, for example, Afghanistan and Iraq.  However, these are "achievements" of the U.S. army on overthrowing the previous regimes and "liberating" the two countries.
How about the human rights situation in U.S.?
Just like last year, the report has not said one word on that.
On March 1, the Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China released the "The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2003", which complemented the shortcoming of the U.S. human rights report.
The article was based on a large number of facts and introduced the human rights problems in U.S. as well as U.S. violations of human rights in other countries.
In history, the people of America have the tradition of honesty and would not hesitate to admit their mistakes.
The young Washington who cut a cherry tree is a lively example that we all know very well.
Today, U.S. is the only super power in the world but it does not speak too many honest words any more.
Recently, mainstream media in Japan have quietly changed their reports on China's economic development.
Contrary to the "China threat" theory before, many reports in Japan started to think China's economic development has pushed ahead Japan's recovery.  The vigorous market demand from China is providing significant momentum to Japan's economic development.
U.S. "Newsweek" also said in a recent article that the up-rise of China is an opportunity, not a threat, to other countries, especially to neighbor countries.
The once widely circulated "China threat" theory is gradually replaced by the "China opportunity" theory.
The "China threat" theory says China's development has become a threat to other countries, especially neighbor countries.
But, China's neighbors did not accept this provoking assertion.
Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir gave an honest opinion before, "Asian countries need not be scared by China's expanding military and economic power because China never has any tradition to conquer other foreign countries."
India's Ministry of Defense also said in its long-term plan that China has not posed any military threat to India.
In economy and trade, governments and enterprises around the world have taken the Chinese market as their best choice for expansion.  Overseas investors with strategic vision have written the "China opportunity" theory with steady actions: among the top 500 enterprises in our world, more than 400 have invested in China.
For several years, China has been occupying the number one position in the world in terms of amount of foreign capital attracted.
GDP is generally accepted as an important macro economic indicator in our world.
It is of crucial importance that we maintain a growth in GDP throughout the modernization and development process in our nation.
Judging simply from the fact that one percent growth in our GDP these days could create corresponding employment for eight hundred thousand people, we have to maintain a fast growth trend in our economy.
To a very great extent, the magnificent objective of building a full-scale fairly prosperous society and the realization of the third strategic framework of modernization rely on a sustained high growth in GDP.
Nevertheless, we can visualize the GDP indicator also has many defects.
For example, it does not precisely reflect the quality and structure of the economic growth.  It does not reflect the level of social benefits actually enjoyed by people.  It also does not measure resources allocation or social justice in our society, etc. etc.
In addition, GDP is also not the only indicator.
When we assess achievements of the governing process, we cannot simply confine ourselves to GDP growth.  We need to look at the level of material and culture life actually enjoyed by people.  We have to check the unemployment rate in the area, social security, social justice, social order, social administration and social harmony etc. etc.
Therefore, we have to use scientific spirit, scientific attitude and scientific thought to deal with the existing computation system for GDP and properly position the GDP indicator within the overall development of our society.
We need to maintain a certain growth rate but not putting too much emphasis on that.  We cannot adopt a one-sided view and pursue it painstakingly.
Economic development and elimination of poverty are the fundamental premises to realize sustainable development.
Sustainable economic development is the material foundation for environmental protection and overall progress in our society.
If the question of survival is not solved, development becomes irrelevant and no one can talk about sustainable development.
Endeavor to economic advancement and elimination of poverty is developing countries' only route to sustainable development.
If the poverty problem in developing countries is not solved, it will also be difficult for developed countries to continue their development.
Sensible usage of resources and protection of environment are inevitable requirements for realization of sustainable development.
Development based on wastage of resources and contamination to environment cannot possibly continue for long.
The supply of natural resources is limited and certainly not inexhaustible but demands continue to increase because of development in our society.  If the relation between these two factors is not properly managed, the ecological environment will necessarily deteriorate, which then seriously threatens the existence and development of mankind.
The only route to sustainable development is a recycle economy, which is based on the foundation of environmental protection and makes the most efficient use of resources.
The ultimate goal of sustainable development is to improve our society across the broad and enhance both the standard and quality of people's living.
A year ago, the 9th informal Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leadership meeting took place at the Huangpu riverside in Shanghai.  I can still clearly remember the scenes at that time.
Today, we gather again at the beautiful Los Cabos on the other side of Pacific Ocean to discuss major programs of economic cooperation in Asia Pacific.
I am delighted to meet with some old friends again.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to President Fox's gracious invitation and Mexico government's careful arrangement.
In the past year, the globalization trend continues and technology advances with each passing day.  All these have brought forth new development opportunities for all nations.
At the same time, the uncertainties in global economic development have increased.  Some countries and regions, including some members of APEC, are facing new challenges in their economic development process.
Trade protectionism has resurged.  It is still a long way before we can have free, fair and impartial trades.
The fight against terrorism is difficult and complicated, which increases non-traditional security considerations.
Our world is still not too peaceful.
Even though international community is still facing this kind and that kind of problems, and there might also be other unexpected problems here and there in future, but the era of peace and development is irreversible.  The wishes of people in all nations to pursue better livings have never changed.
The theme of the meeting and the dialogue this time is development, which has a lot of meaning.
Development is the foundation for progress in human civilization.  It is a crucial factor for the resolution of different problems and contradiction facing our world.
It needs coordinated, balanced and widespread development across the world before everlasting peace and stability can be achieved in the globe.
We need to have a comprehensive and in depth study on this topic and make concerted efforts to resolve the issue.
The pace of globalization is accelerating and becomes the most conspicuous characteristic of the current economy in our world.
Stimulated by globalization, associations among nations and regions have tightened and markets are more opened.  The movement of capital, technology and talents becomes swift and widespread.  All these bring forth unprecedented opportunities to strengthen international cooperation for mutual development.
Meanwhile, globalization also brings forth serious challenges.  The gap between south and north has widened.  Some developing countries are facing the danger of being further marginalized.  Economic and financial risks have increased and international crimes become more serious.  All of these have increased the urgency to start international cooperation to deal with the challenges together.
At a time when opportunities and challenges coexist, we should grasp the opportunities and respond to challenges.  We have to put aside minor differences so as to seek common ground.  We need to enlarge cooperation and stimulate globalization such as to move towards common development and prosperity.
(International) Flu Outbreak in U.S. Reaches New High
Xinhua News Agency, Los Angeles, December 31st (Reporter: Yan Liang) - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated on December 31st that the worst flu outbreak not seen in U.S. for 30 years has reached a new high.  Among the 50 states in U.S., 45 of them have reported widespread of flu and the death cases caused by flu are increasing rapidly.
According to the Center's statistics to December 20th, 7.8% of total death cases in America was attributed to flu, which was a record high.
At least 42 children have died from flu complications in U.S. and the death cases among adults have also gone up rapidly.  However, it is impossible to have the exact figure at the moment.
Experts believed that there are two reasons for the serious outbreak of flu in 2003: first, last year's prevailing "Panama strain A" is no longer the predominant flu virus this year, which renders vaccines made earlier an ineffective protection; second, owing to last year's overproduction in flu vaccines, the two major vaccine producers reduced this year's production to 83 million doses and hence, effectively created a shortage in supply this year.
The social unrest caused by this flu outbreak is rarely seen despite on average 36,000 people died and about 114,000 people hospitalized for flu-related complications each year in U.S.
Mr. William Thompson, a U.S. epidemiologist, believed that this is the worst flu outbreak for U.S. in 30 years.  Flu has come earlier than usual this year and is already widespread in many schools causing long queues in many flu vaccination centers.
Under such severe circumstances, U.S. department of health has activated its emergency operations center on December 19th and dispatched teams of health specialists to every state to cope with the situation.
Three killed When Two Vehicles Collided in an Accident in Zhejiang, China
Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 1st, (Reporters: Fang Lie and Zhang Hongming) - A serious traffic accident took place in Ninghai County, Zhejiang Province in the early morning of January 1st.
Owing to heavy fog, an overloaded sedan collided with a heavy truck.  There were seven people on board the sedan and three were killed while the other four were wounded.
At about 2:00 a.m. on January 1st, driver Hua of a Red Flag taxi with license plate BT8705 (Zhejiang) was taking six passengers from Linhai to Ninghai.
At that time, the road was very foggy and visibility was poor.
When the taxi traveled 60.7 kilometers on the Yong-Ning line, it collided with a big tow-truck, license plate B35378 (Hopei), traveling in the same direction.
It was understood that the heavy truck was moving from the take-over lane back to the main lane but the taxi was unable to give way in time.  The taxi ran underneath the truck right at its mid section and was totally wrecked.  Among the 7 people on board the taxi, 3 died at scene, including the taxi driver.
After the accident, the Highway Traffic Police Detachment of Zhejiang Province promptly issued notices to all traffic police detachments, requesting them to take immediate measures to strengthen traffic management under adverse weather conditions.  It is important to ensure road safety during the spring festival and prevent traffic accidents caused by overloading and speeding.

(International) U.S. Rescue Team Does Not Talk Politics in Iran
Xinhua News Agency, Bam, Iran, January 2 (Reporter: Jiang Xiaofeng and Liao Zhenyun) - A U.S. team is taking part in earthquake rescue work in Bam, Iraq.  Nevertheless, Steve Catlin, the coordinator for the U.S. Agency for International Development told Xinhua on the 2nd that the participation of U.S. team had nothing to do with politics.
Catlin pointed out the U.S. rescue team has "nothing to do with politics".  In fact, U.S. has provided similar humanitarian aids to Iran.
He said the U.S. team has 81 members.  The team has set up a city search group and a military hospital in Bam area.  Several smaller units are responsible to go into the city to assess the damage to houses.
They have brought relief resources including plastic sheets and tents etc.
When Catlin was asked about how long the rescue team would stay in Bam, he said, "We will stay here as long as the host (Iran government) let us stay."
Catlin also said the U.S. rescue team is completely free to move around in Bam.  There is no Iran police to follow them or protect them.
Furthermore, he believed that Iran government's disaster response and management capability is "first class and outstanding".
U.S. Agency for International Development is an institution under U.S. International Development Cooperation Agency.  Both are under the jurisdiction of the State Department.
U.S. and Iran terminated their diplomatic relation in 1980 and have never resumed normal relation since then.
U.S. still regards Iran as a "supporter of terrorism" and part of the "axis of evil".
In response to the request for actions by Iran's ambassador to United Nations, U.S. has sent the rescue team to Iran.
(International) Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Denied Plans to Expand Golan Heights Settlements
Xinhua News Agency, London, January 2 - Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Olmert denied on the 2nd that Israel was planning to expand Jewish settlements in Golan Heights.  He said there were "no plan" and "no policy" for that.
Israeli Minister of Agriculture Katz told media on December 31st last year that Israeli government was planning to double the number of Jewish settlers in Golan Heights to strengthen its control there before any peace dialogue with Syria.
In an interview by British Broadcasting Corporation, Olmert said Katz's comment about plans to develop agriculture, tourism and settlements on the Golan Heights was a mistake.
"I have checked it time after time with the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister in the past two days.  According to the government's commitments, there is no such approved plan," he said.
He said Israeli government would not support this type of plans notwithstanding some ministers might be in favor of them.
Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the third Middle East war in 1967.  There are currently a total of 17,000 Jewish settlers there.
Israel and Syria are still technically at war because of that.
Katz's comment on settlement expansion in Golan Heights provoked wide spread concerns in the international community.  Syria condemned Israel's expansion plans and stressed that they would be illegal.
A High-Tech Weaponry Industry in China: an "Embryo" Appeared
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 3 (Reporter: Li Zhengyi and Li Bin) - In the past one year, weapon research and structure reform in the China Weaponry Industry Corp., one of the top ten military contractors in China, have achieved important breakthrough and progress.
Ma Zhigeng, General Manager of China Weaponry Industry Corp. said on the 3rd in Beijing that his company made a sales of RMB 49.7 billion in 2003, up 19.7% over corresponding period.  All companies in the group had turned from loss into profit two years ahead of plan and a high-tech weaponry industry started to take shape in China.
The weaponry industry is the largest among all defense industries in China.  It has a fundamental strategic role in the process of defense modernization.
In the past several years, China Weaponry Industry Corp. insisted to apply latest technology and assembled the best talents.  On one hand, the group applied high-tech to develop weapons and on the other hand, it implemented reform and achieved an economy in scale on par with private sector industries.  The group had successfully developed a batch of new high-tech weaponry urgently needed by the Chinese army.  Finally, the group developed the capability in research and production of high-tech military products.
Meanwhile, China Weaponry Industry Corp. aggressively pushed forward a structural adjustment including a total of 21 bankruptcies and closure of enterprises.  The total number of staff has decreased from 476 thousand at the time of its formation to 360 thousand now, a decrease of 116 thousand.  Six enterprises have been listed on the stock exchange after restructure.
(International) Mongolia's Livestock Industry Had a Better Year in 2003
Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, January 5 (Reporter: Li Guodong) - According to local media reports on the 5th, Mongolia had 25.3078 million head of livestock on hand as at end of 2003, up 1.6233 million head over same time previous year.
This was the first rebound in the number of livestock on hand in Mongolia after a massive drop for 3 consecutive years.
Last year, there was plenty of rain in the summer but no heavy snowstorm in spring and winter.  The nice weather has created favorable conditions for the livestock industry in Mongolia.
As at end of 2003, Mongolia had 255.6 thousand camels, 1.9583 million horses, 1.7843 million cows, 10.7062 million sheep and 10.6034 million goats.
On comparison with previous year, the number of camel, goat and sheep increased but the number of horse and cow has decreased.
Mongolia's livestock industry was basically privatized in the 90s of last century.
After privatization, the livestock industry relies very much on the "cooperation of mother nature".
From 1994 to 1999, Mongolia's livestock industry enjoyed six blooming years because of favorable weather.
At the end of 1999, Mongolia had 33.5 million head of livestock on hand and set the historic high.
However, Mongolia's livestock industry experienced setback from 2000 to 2002 because of consecutive snowstorms in winters and drought in summers over 3 consecutive years.
At the end of 2002, Mongolia had 23.6845 million head of livestock on hand, which was a decrease of 98.155 million head of livestock in three years.
(International) North Korea Would Use Its Military Power to Fight American Forces
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 6 (Reporter: Ji Xinlong) - North Korean Central News Agency released a commentary on the 6th demanding United States to solve the North Korea nuclear problem with good intention.  The commentary said North Korea will further strengthen its military power and is not hesitate to use its military power to fight American forces.
According to the commentary, it is important to reduce tensions, safeguard peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula.  It is of utmost importance that the nuclear problem between North Korea and U.S. be resolved peacefully through dialogue.
North Korea has already proposed a basket of solutions which is based on the principle of simultaneous actions
The commentary reiterated North Korea's consistent standpoint to resolve the nuclear problem through dialogue.
U.S. government should deal with North Korea's standpoint with good intention.
However, U.S. has recently transported a large quantity of weapons that were tested in Afghanistan and Iraq battlefields as well as other advanced weapons into South Korea.  U.S. is simply accelerating their preparation to provoke a new war.
The commentary also said in response to "America's total denial and its unyielding policy to threaten North Korea's systems and belief, North Korea is prepared to respond in a super tough way".  North Korea will defend its sovereign rights and existence.  It will pursue appropriate self-defense to protect the peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the whole region.
As the U.S. threats become bigger, North Korea has to strengthen its battle line against the U.S. Empire and will use its military power to fight American forces.
(International) U.S. Service Industries Grow at a Slower Pace than Manufacturing
Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 6 (Reporter: Xue Yanping) - A report published on the 6th by a famous research institution in U.S., the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), said the Service Industry Index fell in last December indicating service industries were lagging behind manufacturing.
The report said the Service Industry Index, which includes retail, financial services, construction and other non-manufacturing, fell from 60.1 in last November to 58.6 in last December.  Economists had previously forecasted the Index to rise to 60.5.
According to ISM standard, a Service Industry Index over 50 indicates an expansion while a figure below 50 indicates a contraction in the industry.
According to another report published by ISM on the 2nd, U.S. Manufacturing Index surged in December to a 20-year high.
This shows U.S. service industries are growing at a slower pace than manufacturing.
Growth in manufacturing helps create more jobs and also promotes economic growth.  However, a growth in service industries usually has a more significant effect in the reduction of unemployment and the stimulation of economic growth.

(International) 35 Soldiers Wounded in an Attack on a U.S. Military Base
Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, January 7 (Reporter: Li Jizhi and Nie Xiaoyang) - U.S. military in Iraq said in a statement on the 7th that 35 soldiers were wounded during a mortar attack on a logistical base west of Baghdad.
The statement said six mortars struck the base during an attack by unidentified armed personnel at about 6:45 pm local time.
The wounded soldiers were transferred to nearby military hospital for medical treatment.  However, the statement did not elaborate on the extent of injuries or any further details about the attack.
While the mortar attack did not kill any soldiers, it was the fiercest attack since the former Iraqi president Saddam was captured on December 13 last year.
Since the U.S. and British coalition started the Iraq war in March last year, 331 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Iraq during attacks.
According to another report, unidentified armed personnel fired their guns at an inspection point near the northern Iraq city, Kirkuk and later escaped.
One Iraq policeman and one civilian were shot and died.
Since the occupation by the coalition, close to 200 Iraq police officers have been killed in attacks.
(International) Portugal's Long-Living Woman Is Going to Celebrate 113th Birthday
Xinhua News Agency, Lisbon, January 7 (Reporter: Zhao Xiaozhong) - Media in Portugal reported on the 7th that Catarina Carreiro, the second oldest woman in the world according to Guinness Book of World Records, is going to celebrate her 113th birthday with family members on the 9th.
Carreiro was born on January 9, 1891.  She is currently living in Penha Garcia, Beira Baixa district, central Portugal.
Her family includes five generations with six children, 26 grandchildren, 39 great-grandchildren and 7 great-great-grandchildren.
On her 113th birthday, the five generations will gather together to celebrate her longevity.
However, Carreiro's family members said everything would be kept simple because the old lady is rather weak and gets up from bed only in the afternoon.
Media in Portugal reported that the world's oldest woman, according to Guinness Book of Records, is a U.S. citizen Charlotte Benkner.  She was born on November 6, 1889.
Both Charlotte Benkner and Catarina Carreiro have yet to the break the record set by France's Jeanne Calment, who died at 122 in 1997.
Health Checks for Drivers Entering and Leaving Shenzhen
Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, January 8 (Reporter: Li Nanling and Hong Wen) - In order to protect public health and prevent transmission of the contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) into and out of Shenzhen, the Shenzhen Municipal Inspection and Quarantine Bureau (SMIQB) issued a statement a few days ago and decided to implement universal health and quarantine measures on all drivers entering and exiting the three land ports at Huanggang, Wenjindu (Man Kam To) and Shatoujiao (Sha Tau Kok) starting from the 9th.  Drivers have to fill out a health and quarantine declaration form and their body temperature will also be taken.
It is understood that practical difficulties do exist at Shenzhen because of the vast number of vehicles entering and exiting the ports.  There are on average 25,000 vehicle-times crossing Huanggang and close to 10,000 vehicle-times at Wenjindu.  It is not so easy to keep traffic flowing smoothly and yet, enforces health inspections on all drivers at the same time.
SMIQB has overcome many difficulties in order to perfect the job of taking body temperature, collecting and checking health declaration forms.  Apart from an internal transfer that helped place more hands on the front line, SMIQB also urgently recruited an additional 250 staffs and put them through intensive training.  The new recruits will be deployed to strengthen the front line of ports to ensure smooth and safe traffic at the ports.  At the same time, the bureau also purchased an additional 60 portable high-performance infrared thermal detectors to satisfy the workload.

They should not prosecute me.  They need to do a thorough investigation of the whole matter."
Rusedski swore that he would "fight this injustice to the end".
He insisted that he did not use any banned drugs to enhance performance.
He said he was not the cause of the matter and the issue affects everyone in professional tennis.

(International) Syria Demanded Israel to Take Peace Seriously
Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, January 12 - Even though Israeli President Katsav invited Syrian President Assad to visit Jerusalem for peace talks, the Permanent Representative of Syria to United Nations (UN), Fayssal Mekdad, said Israel must first seriously consider the problem hindering peace and returns the occupied Golan Heights back to Syria.
Mekdad said an invitation by Israeli President Katsav has no effects unless Israel "seriously respects" the UN resolution demanding Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights.
He stressed that Israel has to withdraw before there is a chance for peace.  Syria will never concede its territory.
Mekdad pointed out Israeli President has mainly a ceremonial role.  It is actually Prime Minister Sharon and his cabinet that are running Israel.
"We will not negotiate with the Israeli president.  This matter has to be negotiated with the Israel government," he said.
Earlier, Israeli President Katsav suddenly announced through public radio stations that he is inviting Syrian President Assad to Jerusalem for talks with Israeli leaders.
Syria believed that was only an act for the news.
Recently, Syria has stepped up diplomatic assault on Israel in an attempt to restart the peace talks between the two countries.
However, Sharon said Syria has to show its will and terminate terrorism before the two countries can resume peace talks.

In a New Year press conference, entitled "Changes, Stability and Hope", at the Presidential palace Chong Wa Dae, Roh Moo-hyun said South Korea's development strategy and plans are all based on a peaceful Korean Peninsula and hence, the development of a stable relationship with North Korea becomes a critical issue.
Despite impacts of the nuclear problem, South and North Korea held 38 talks in 2003 and the dialogue lasted for 106 days.  This clearly illustrated the "slow but realistic" progress in South-North Korea relation in the past year.
In this year, South Korea will continue to develop South-North relation, including practical issues, on top of its solid foundation in national security.  South Korea will continue to promote the resolution of North Korea's nuclear problem in a peaceful way.
If the North Korea nuclear problem can be solved, the relation between the two Koreas might take another turn and has the opportunity to advance to a new high.

(International) Brazil Continues to Fingerprint and Photograph U.S. Tourists
Xinhua News Agency, Rio De Janeiro, January 13 - Brazil's second largest city, Rio De Janeiro, continues to fingerprint and photograph arriving U.S. citizens at its airport and piers on the 13th.
In order to reduce impacts to tourism, Rio de Janeiro tourism board is handing out small gifts to arriving U.S. citizens to make them feel right at home.
The small gift pack includes a bunch of roses and a T-shirt with the words "Rio loves you" on it.
The tourism board hopes a small gift to Americans might help to lessen the frustration at the line up for fingerprint and photograph.
"This is a small welcome act but it makes clear how important the American tourists are to us," said Rio's tourism sub-secretary, Paulo Bastos.
He said the new policy of fingerprinting and photographing Americans have already caused about 320 Americans to cancel their sightseeing trip to Brazil.
The U.S. government decided last year to start fingerprinting and photographing of foreigners, including Brazilian citizens, when they enter United States from January 5 this year.
The Brazil government adopted the same policy against arriving Americans from January 1 as a protest of the American policy.
The U.S. government expressed its dissatisfaction to Brazil's reaction several times already.
U.S. Secretary of State Powell has personally phoned Brazil's Foreign Minister Amorin this week and demanded Brazil to cancel the "discriminating" policy against U.S. citizens.
Amorin also asked U.S. to adopt reciprocal actions.
(International) Norway Begins Fresh Peace Effort in Sri Lanka
Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, January 14 - Norway's Ambassador to Colombo Hans Brattskar traveled to a northern town held by rebels for peace talks with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) on the 14th in a bid to restart the peace-brokering process, which was previously suspended due to a political crisis in Sri Lanka.
A spokesman for Sri Lanka cabinet, Peiris, told reporters that Brattskar is going to hold talks with Tamilselvan, leader of the LTTE's Political Wing, later in the day.
Meanwhile, Norwegian envoy Solheim was due to meet LTTE's chief negotiator, Balasingham, in London.
This is the first occasion for a Norwegian envoy to meet a LTTE representative in two months.
On November 4 last year, Sri Lankan President Madam Kumaratunga abruptly sacked the Defense Minister Marapone, Interior Minister Amaratunga and Information Minister Markar, accusing them of giving too many concessions in their talks with LTTE.
Norwegian officials said 10 days later they would temporarily suspend the peace-brokering process in view of the political crisis in Sir Lanka.
(Archaeological Discovery) 31 Qin Tombs Found at Fengxiang County, Shaanxi Province, China
Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 15 (Reporter: Tiema) - In the past, historians believed that the palace area at Nantou village of Sun Family, Fengxiang County, Baoji City, Shaanxi Province became an important sacrificial graveyard of Qin royal family only after Qin state moved the capital city to Yong Town.  However, Shaanxi Archaeological Institute has accidentally found 31 Qin tombs at the palace area a few days ago, which might change this belief.
In order to satisfy the request of a company in Baoji City to build a factory at the site of the ruins, the Shaanxi Archaeological Institute conducted an archaeological exploration of the vicinity.  The company was in urgent need of about 20,000 square meters of land but the Institute found 31 Qin tombs of Western Zhou to Chunqiu period right inside that area.
After Shaanxi Yong Town Archaeological team performed further digging and cleared up the ancient tombs, they found 40 bronze and pottery relics.
One of the Qin tombs has an outer coffin and two inner coffins.  There is also a sacrificial bury of two horses by the side of the tomb.
Inside this tomb, 15 bronze and pottery relics were unearthed.  The bronze relics included dings (a three-legged ancient Chinese cooking vessel), pots and axes etc.
Among these relics, the bronze dings had very elegant craving on them and demonstrated sophisticated craftsmanship.  These relics help reveal the style of bronze casting during Western Zhou period.
Judging from the sacrificial objects, the tomb probably belonged to a Qin duke of late Western Zhou period.
Based on this finding, experts speculated that there might be a large group of ancient tombs in nearby area.
This accidental discovery has a lot of value in the studies of the relocation of capital in Qin Dynasty and the overall layout of Yong Town in Qin and Han periods.
According to introduction by Tian Yaqi, Assistant Researcher of Shaanxi Archaeological Institute and team leader of Yong Town Archaeological Team, historians have long believed that the palace area at Nantou village of Sun Family became an important sacrificial graveyard of Qin royal family in Qin and Western Zhou period only after the Qin state moved capital to Yong Town.
However, the discovery indicated that the area was a conferred county in Western Zhou Dynasty and had gone through several ups and downs well before the relocation of the capital to Yong Town.

The Seattle based Starbucks has opened 7,000 chain stores in more than 30 countries.
Judging from outside the store, the new store looks more like a McDonald fast food outlet than a European cafe.

(International) In Red Sea: The Two Black Boxes of the Crashed Plane Have Been Found
Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 17 - On the 16th, the joint ocean salvage team of France and Egypt recovered a black box from a jetliner that crashed into the Red Sea.  Thereafter, the team found the second black box of the crashed plane on the 17th at the deep bottom of sea.
The head of the Egyptian salvage team, Hamdi Sami, said the French "Scorpio" robot submarine was trying to recover the second black box, which was used to record sounds in the cockpit.  It is estimated that the box can be brought to surface on the morning of 18th (local time).
The two black boxes were found at a depth of 1,000 meters and they were about 30 meters apart.
Shaker Qilada, head of the Egyptian investigation team, said the first black box had recorded all kinds of technical data prior to the crash.  The box will be handed to a laboratory of Egyptian Civil Aviation for "decoding and analysis".
Even though the black box appeared to be seriously damaged, Qilada said it was in "good condition".
The two so-called black boxes on the plane are actually yellow in color.
In order to help search teams to locate and recover black boxes, they are designed to send a signal on a continuous basis for 30 days from a depth up to 6,000 meters below sea.
The plane crashed in Red Sea belongs to a private Egyptian airline company, the Flash Airlines.
The Boeing 737 crashed into the Red Sea on the 3rd of this month shortly after take-off from the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh.  All 148 aboard, including 134 French, one Moroccan and 13 Egyptian crewmembers, were killed.
Egyptian and French experts believed the accident was caused by a mechanical failure rather than a terror attack or explosion.  As the black boxes were found, they will help reveal this puzzle.
China: Breakthrough in Cryo-Preservation at Ultra-Low Temperature and Replantation of a Severed Finger
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, January 18 (Reporter: Su Wanming) - China succeeded in the replantation of a severed finger, which was preserved using liquid nitrogen at the ultra-low temperature of -196 degree Celsius.
A scholar in China announced a few days ago an important breakthrough in ultra-low temperature cryo-preservation and replantation of a severed finger.
A few days ago, the Department of Hand and Foot Surgery at Shandong Provincial Hospital had once again replanted a severed finger successfully for a patient (the severed finger was preserved by liquid nitrogen at ultra-low temperature of -196 degree Celsius for 5 days).  This is the second surgery by the hospital since its first successful replantation of a severed finger last year (preserved in liquid nitrogen at ultra-low temperature of -196 degree Celsius for 81 days).
The Health Department's consultation report on new technology in medicine and medical treatment has confirmed that these are the only two cases in the world of a successful replantation of a severed finger after cryo-preservation at ultra-low temperature.
"After a large number of experiments using animals and together with the two applications in clinical cases, we have already mastered the basic techniques in preserving a severed finger at ultra-low temperature," said Wang Zengtao, Director, Department of Hand and Foot Surgery, Shandong Provincial Hospital.
According to introduction by Wang Zengtao, the structure and makeup of a human finger are more complicated than many other organs like the heart or the kidney etc.  The finger is a complex tissue including blood vessels, nerves, tendons, skin, bone, joints and ligament etc.
The Cryo-preservation of a severed Finger at ultra-low temperature and the related replantation techniques involve a series of complicated steps and know how including the preparation of cryo-preservative solution, cryo-preservation procedure, temperature restoration, replantation, refill finger and protect it from further injury etc.
This technique becomes an important reference for other research on cryo-preservation of other human organs over a long period of time at ultra-low temperature.

The Chinese ambassador Tien Cang Cun said the financial grant conveys the friendly feelings of Chinese government and the people of China towards Albanian government and the people of Albania.  At the same time, it also reflects the traditional friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
(International) U.S. Troops Killed 3 Non-Iraqis in Iraq
Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, January 19 (Reporter: Li Jizhi and Nie Xiaoyang) - The Iraq police said on the 19th that U.S. troops in Iraq killed two Yemenis and a Syrian during a weapon search in the southern suburb of Baghdad on that day.
Police said U.S. soldiers found the three men during a search for "terrorist safe house".  U.S. soldiers opened fire and killed them when they refused to surrender.
U.S. soldiers later raided the house and found some rifles, grenades and dynamite etc.
U.S. soldiers have also taken into custody a Yemeni woman at the scene.
U.S. and Iraqi officials believed foreign religious extremists might be crossing the loosely guarded borders into Iraq and colluded with anti-America forces in Iraq.  They then launched terror attacks against U.S. troops and pro-America Iraqis.
On the 18th, a suicide bomber set off a powerful car bomb outside the coalition head quarters in the city center of Baghdad killing 24 people and wounded over a hundred.  The majority of the victims were Iraqis.
(International) Recovery in U.S. High Tech Is Envisaged As Jobless Rate Declines in Silicon Valley
Xinhua News Agency, Los Angeles, January 19 (Reporter: Yan Liang) - According to a research report released by an influential economic research institution in U.S. Silicon Valley a few days ago, the jobless rate has been falling at a rapid rate in Silicon Valley.
This is a clear signal that high tech industry in the area is heading for a rebound.
In its annual report, the "2004 Index of Silicon Valley", the non-profit institution "Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network" said the jobless rate in Silicon Valley has decreased from 10% in the second quarter of 2002 to 5% in the second quarter of 2003.
The report believed that jobless rate would continue to drop as the high tech industry gradually recovers.
At present, economic development in Silicon Valley is facing the challenge of finding a large number of highly trained workers to fill up the new jobs that are going to be created.
The report said biotech has the lowest unemployment rate and the clearest signs of a recovery among the different high tech industries in Silicon Valley.  In 2003, biotech had attracted, for the first time, about the same amount of venture capital as the software industry.
The report believed biotech is going to play a more and more important role in the economic development in Silicon Valley.
The report also said the average salary between second quarter 2002 and second quarter 2003 showed a decline for the third year in a row but the slide had slowed from 6% a year ago to 1.5%.
Silicon Valley is still a rich area in the United States.  The average salary in the area was US$62,400 a year, which was 64% higher than the American average.
However, the average cost of living in the area was also 47% higher than the nation's average.
(Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) Hong Kong SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa Delivered a Chinese New Year Congratulatory Speech
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 21 - "Good Luck and Nice Conditions In Every Corners; Abundant New Opportunities All Over Our World".
On the eve of the Chinese New Year, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and his wife, Tung Chiu Hung Ping, delivered a congratulatory address through televisions, radio stations and the Internet wishing Hong Kong and its citizens a prosperous and happy new year.
Tung Chee Hwa said this year's Chinese New Year has a special meaning to Hong Kong citizens and is also a specifically joyous one.
After some difficult years in Hong Kong, the economy is now experiencing a V-shaped rebound, with unemployment falling, deflation easing and the property market stabilizing.  The Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) is now effective.  Tourists are flocking in, boosting sales and everyone is feeling much better than before.
"It is even more gratifying to note that after years of hard work, we have laid a solid foundation for the successful economic restructuring in Hong Kong as well as its further development," Tung Chee Hwa said.
He said he wishes everyone to have a smooth going with everything in the New Year.
Tung Chee Hwa said Hong Kong communities have already arrived at a common consensus for the direction of Hong Kong's future.  Everyone is now facing new opportunities one after the other.
The coming year is the year of Monkey.
"Monkey" implies clever, sharp and full of vitality.
With unceasing efforts of the government, the citizens of Hong Kong and together with the support from the central government, Hong Kong can turn any adversity around and out of the depth of misfortune will come bliss.
(International) Arab League Secretary-General Urged U.S. Not to Impose "Democracy" on Middle East
Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, January 21 - Moussa, Secretary-General, League of Arab States (Arab League) urged on the 21st that U.S. should never attempted to impose democracy to Middle East but rather discuss democracy with Arab countries.
"If they (the Americans) want democracy in Middle East, they better live up with their promise and implement democracy in Iraq first," Moussa told reporters in the World Economic Forum, currently in session at Davos, Switzerland.
He said the Arab League is America's best partner to discuss democratic reform in the Middle East area.
"As long as you propose your idea and are willing to listen to our viewpoint, then we can talk about anything.
We do not oppose democracy.  However, democracy is not a process or an order that can be executed immediately."
Moussa pointed out that U.S. government has yet to convince people that they can bring "democracy" to Iraq by invading the country.
"They said they went to Iraq to show us a sample of democracy.
However, we have seen nothing up till now."
Total Revenue from China's Tourism Industry Estimated to be RMB 487.5 Billion in 2003
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 22 (Reporter: Sun Yubo) - In 2003, China's estimated total revenue from international and domestic tourism was RMB 487.4 billion, down 12.4% over previous year but was still better than expected.
According to statistics by State Tourism Administration, China received 91 million traveler-times of inbound tourists in 2003, of which 11.3 million traveler-times were foreigners.  Tourists that spent a night in China were 32.7 million traveler-times.  Total foreign currency revenue from tourism amounted to US$17.3 billion.
The number of domestic travelers was 870 million traveler-times and domestic travel revenue amounted to RMB 344.2 billion, down 0.9% and 11% over previous year respectively.
The relevant official in charge at State Tourism Administration said the tourism industry would strive for a total recovery of inbound tourism in 2004.  The industry will continue to develop and promote the domestic travel market.  The industry will also intensify the reform in tourism market and better manage market order.
Meanwhile, the industry is going to do their best to organize the year of "Life Style Travel for Common People".  Based on this theme of "Life Style Travel for Common People", the industry will focus on the planning and launching of a series of travel products that reflects the life style of Chinese citizens.
(International) Economists See U.S. as Biggest Winner for a Weak U.S. Dollar
Xinhua News Agency, Davos, Switzerland, January 23 (Reporter: Li Jie and Ding Xigang) - In the 34th World Economic Forum currently in session at Davos of Switzerland, economists held a special topic discussion on the U.S. dollar's devaluation trend on the 23rd.  Some economists forecasted that United States would be the biggest winner on the continual weakness of the U.S. currency.
The majority of the economists at the meeting believed that U.S. officials, including Secretary of United States Department of Treasury John Snow, appeared to have abandoned the "strong dollar" policy in recent years.
A weak dollar can provide greater economic development opportunities and creates more jobs, a point most obvious in the manufacturing industry.
At the same time, the devaluation of the U.S. unit renders U.S. products more competitive in domestic and foreign markets, which in turn can help reduce U.S. trade deficit.
However, economists also believed the weak dollar would bring forth negative impacts to U.S.
First, U.S. stock market may continue to track at a low level as the value of different types of investment fall.  Overseas investors may withdraw their money as they worry about further devaluation of the dollar.  Second, the cost of imports becomes more expensive, which will eventually lead to erosion of the standard of living in America.  Third, a massive devaluation might trigger instability in international trade and finance.
In addition, the dollar devaluation also brings forth more serious impact to Europe, Japan and Canada.
Europe finds it more difficult to export products after the drop of the dollar, which might endanger the European economy and pushes Europe into a full recession.
China Will Accelerate the Development of Applied Electronics for Automobiles and Medial Devices Etc.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 26 (Reporter: Ping Xiaofang) - China will accelerate the development of various types of applied electronics for use in automobiles, machineries, traffic control and medical devices etc.  The efforts will enhance the development opportunities of electronic & information technology industry and, at the same time, can usefully satisfy demands from different industries.
The official in-charge at China's Ministry of Information Industry said reform and improvement of traditional enterprises is one of the focal points in the promotion of wider application of information technology.
The promotion of wider application of information technology in all trades and professions is not only a necessity in the reform and improvement of traditional industries but it can also advance the overall market share of China made products and equipment.  The efforts will also create hard to come by opportunities for the electronics & information technology industry.
According to introduction, in the pursuit of further development in the electronic & information technology industry and the satisfaction of demands from industries, China must also help build a system with common technological services capability and provides support to solid research companies.  Through provision of technology standards and testing environment, China can provide key industries with the necessary support and protection in their application of information technology.
At the same time, China should develop businesses in technical services, management consultancy and system integration etc.  To this end, China has to support a batch of service providers including system integration services and application services etc.  Collectively, these efforts can promote the development of a new information services industry.
(International) Japan's Imports and Exports Rose to New Record Levels in 2003
Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 26 (Reporter: Le Shaoyan) - According to statistics published by Japan Ministry of Finance on the 26th, Japan's imports and exports rose to new record levels in 2003.  After a break of 3 years, trade surplus had once again exceeded 10 trillion yen.
In exports, the amount of exports to United States was down 9.8% over previous year but Japan's exports to Asia had surged by a massive 12.9%.
The decline in exports to the United States has been more than offset by robust exports to Asia.  In fact, the growth in Asia pushed up Japan's total exports for last year by 4.7% reaching a new record high of 54.5589 trillion yen.
In imports, due to increases in demand as well as higher prices in energy resources like petroleum and natural gas, Japan's total imports increased by 5% and amounted to 44.3202 trillion yen in 2003, which was also a new record.
After a break of 3 years, Japan's trade surplus had once again exceeded the 10 trillion yen level - a surplus of 10.2387 trillion yen in 2003 to be exact, up 3.6% over previous year.
In China: Number of Active Privately-Owned Enterprises in Guangdong Has Exceeded the Combined Number of State-Owned Enterprises and their Holding Enterprises
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 26 (reporter: Chen Ji and Hu Yanni) - According to information from the Administration for Industry and Commerce of Guangdong Province, the number of active privately-owned enterprises has exceeded, for the first time, the combined number of state-owned enterprises and their holding enterprises in 2003.  Domestic enterprises had gone through an effective adjustment.
According to statistics, there were 690,000 enterprises of all types (including domestic, privately-owned and foreign invested enterprises) in Guangdong province as at end of 2003, up 0.59% over previous year.
Their makeup: 316,000 were domestic enterprises and the total registered capital were RMB 1,190.27 billion, down 16.4% and up 0.9% over previous year respectively; 323,000 were privately-owned enterprises and the total registered capital were RMB 452.28 billion, up 24.9% and 33.8% respectively; 52,000 were foreign invested enterprises and the total registered capital were US$140.5 billion, up 3.6% and 4.1% respectively.
For the first time, the number of active privately-owned enterprises exceeded the combined number of state-owned enterprises and their holding enterprises.
Amidst this structural adjustment, the combined number of state-owned enterprises and their holding enterprises indeed declined but their resources were gradually picking up.  The average registered capital of an enterprise in this category amounted to RMB 3.76 million, up 20% over end of 2002.
In 2003, statistics indicated a total of 105,000 new registrations for different types of enterprises in Guangdong province, which showed the pattern of a decline in one type of enterprises versus increases for the other two.
The breakdown: 17,000 new domestic enterprises, down 17.6% over corresponding period; 81,600 new privately-owned enterprises and 6,561 new foreign invested enterprises, up 29% and 0.08% over corresponding period.
The ratio of new domestic, privately-owned and foreign invested enterprises to total new registrations was 16:78:6.
(International) WTO Sends Dispute on "Byrd Subsidy" to Arbitration
Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, January 26 (Reporter: Li Jie) - The World Trade Organization (WTO) said on the 26th that it called for a ruling by an arbitration institution regarding the European Union and seven other WTO members' demand for sanctions against the United States over the "Byrd Subsidy"
The demand for sanctions was filed because United States failed to eradicate the "Byrd Amendment" within the time limit stipulated by WTO.
U.S. Congress passed the "Byrd Amendment" in 2000, which obliges the U.S. government to distribute revenue from punitive duties on anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases directly to U.S. companies that were harmed, rather than sending the revenue to U.S. Treasury.
European Union, Japan, and other major U.S. trade partners opposed the U.S. method.
WTO finally decided in January 2003 that the Amendment violated global trade regulations and demanded U.S. to abolish it before December 27 of that year.
However, U.S. did not comply with the WTO ruling.
Recently, European Union, Japan, Canada, Brazil, India, South Korea, Mexico and Chile applied to WTO for an approval to levy additional import tariffs on some U.S. products up to the equivalent amount of U.S. subsidy.
However, U.S. challenged the legality of the complaint and the level of sanction shortly afterwards.
(Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) Chinese New Year Sales Up Ten Percent in Hong Kong
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 28 - Hong Kong Retail Management Association said retail sales during Chinese New Year were satisfactory.  According to sources in the industry, sales went up by 10 percent and some shopping malls experienced an increase of 20 to 30 percent.
Hong Kong Retail Management Association Chairman Yu Pang Chun said mainland China tourists visiting Hong Kong on an Individual basis promoted the spending desire this year and sales were at satisfactory level during the Chinese New Year.  Some retailers in jewellery and garment etc. enjoyed a growth of 20 to 30 percent while mainland tourists accounted for about 10 percent of the total turnover.
He said mainland China tourists are clearly stimulating the markets and the average value of purchase charged to their Renminbi credit cards amounted to $3,000.  Some mainland tourists spent as high as $10,000.
In last year, Hong Kong was affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome and total retail sales dropped by 4%.
Yu Pang Chun forecasted that Hong Kong retail sales could enjoy a single digit growth this year as the economy recovers.  However, the price of goods may go up because of higher costs.
He believed the deflation in Hong Kong would ease this year.
(International) Denmark Proposes New Bill to Curb Immigration
Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, January 28 - News from Copenhagen: Denmark government has submitted a new bill to curb immigration on 28th.
According to the bill, children of immigrants that are born in Denmark will not have the right of automatic citizenship.
The proposal is the latest of a series of restrictive immigration measures introduced by the Denmark government since Rasmussen, leader of Liberal party, took up the office as Prime Minister in November 2001.
According to reports, the bill is likely to be adopted by parliament because the Liberal party has the support of the right wing Danish People's Party on the issue of immigrants.
The bill requires children of foreigners born in Denmark to present naturalization application when they turn adults, just like any other immigrant.  They will not have automatic citizenship.
Naturalized immigrants will be stripped of Danish citizenship if they commit serious crimes against society.
In the past two years, Denmark government introduced a series of restrictive measures to curb immigration including more restrictive requirement on the eligibility of permanent residence permits and eligibility to bring in family members.
Since the Denmark government does not welcome immigrants, the number of asylum seekers in Denmark has dropped from 14,347 in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003.
As a result, Denmark has tarnished its image as a free society and a defender of human rights.
The achievement of Singapore should not be taken lightly.
Despite advancement in technology, I do not believe we can maintain an ideal environment with a higher standard of living, high quality of life, full employment and increasing salaries when people do not work hard, ignoring social discipline or not adapting to changes in our world.
These beautiful things do not come naturally and cannot be obtained easily.
It is only when the entire population understand they must attach most importance to group interest and make difficult compromise and necessary adjustments before all of us can possess a bright future.
What will Singapore look like ten or twenty years down the road?
We all hope that we can foresee the future but the future is difficult to predict.
A lot of factors are beyond the control of Singapore.
The development of many matters hinges on situational development in our world.
We do not know when problems will arise and, very often, that may involve some kind of luck.
For example, three Singaporean traveled to Hong Kong and contacted the SRAS virus.  Then, this is unforeseeable.
In less than one month's time from the Chinese New Year, there were already three serious safety incidents and several dozens of people died each time.
It is really making people sighed with regrets given the frequency of occurrence and the serious losses in lives.
Several months before these incidents, another several hundred people have died in Chongqing natural gas pipe blowout, several fuel gas explosions in coalmines and other frequent serious traffic accidents.
China is a vast country and densely populated.  Hence, the probability of a disaster is higher than other countries and several dozens or even several hundred people could easily be killed in any accident.  Objectively, this is a reality that has no way out.
However, common sense tells us China's fatal accidents are still far too frequent.
The bulk of these disasters are related to fire, explosion at coalmines, explosion at firecrackers factories and passenger traffic accidents.
This has at least brought out two questions.  One, the safety measure in these areas is too weak.  Two, people have not learned from past tragedies and thus causing similar incidents to take place again and again.
In Singapore, there had been a serious fire disaster at one time when the country was enjoying a high economic growth.  That bitter experience is still remembered today and it has quickly improved Singapore's safety precaution in public places.
Similarly, China is also situated in a very special period of time when it is experiencing a high economic growth and a major transition in the society.
From time to time, we have heard about the accident of a foreign maid fell to death from buildings while working in our country.  The ratio of this number is not ridiculously high.  Nevertheless, given maids are working in a relatively safe environment inside a home, several instances of felling to death are still inconsistent to the low injury rate for this kind of work.
According to statistics, a total of 99 maids of different nationalities fell to death from buildings during January 1999 to June 2003.
Behind these numbers are broken families that can no longer wait for the return of a daughter or a mother.  These are misfortunes that could be avoided.  Hence, it is definitely the direction of our efforts and we must strive to lower the number of such regrets.
According to a public notice released recently by the Indonesian embassy, 96 Indonesian maids have died since 1999 while working in Singapore and some of them were fallen to death from high-rise buildings.
Indonesia government has expressed dissatisfaction many times to accidents involving maids fell to death.  Indonesia government has also imposed new regulations several times to exercise more stringent controls over the quality of maid working here in order to protect the safety of maids.  However, the problem is not satisfactorily resolved.  As a result, it is inevitably that the maid issue perplexes the Singapore-Indonesia relation.
It is certainly bewildering that the fell to death number for maids is actually higher than the number of death involving foreigners working in construction sites.  Therefore, we must consider the issue carefully and investigate deeply into the problem's background and cause.
Mainland China's world-renowned Taiwan expert Chen Kongli has recently published a new book, entitled "Taiwan Observation".
The book included articles mostly written after the first rotation of political party in Taiwan up till Chen Shui-bian's proposal of "one country on each side".  These are the author's observation and thoughts about Taiwan's internal situations and cross-strait relation during the period of "listen to what he [Chen] says and observe his moves".
Articles written two years ago can only be published two years later.  This clearly reflects China's complicated steps in the review and examination of research articles concerning Taiwan.  The lengthy process further illustrates the "Taiwan Observation" is difficult to come by.
For a long time, Chen Kongli's observation and studies on the Taiwan issue have always dealt with concrete matters and he seeks truth from facts independent of and unrestricted by any subjective political framework.  He strives to explore into profound knowledge and penetrating insight that stands head and shoulders above all others.
This characteristic is deeply reinforced in my mind after I read with respect his book.
Since the early eighties in the last century, the study of the Taiwan problem became a "burgeoning field of study".  Different scholars and experts had emerged conspicuously from different research institutions and started to demonstrate their talents.
In overseas countries, people have generally classified Mainland's research institutions on the Taiwan issue into the north clique and the south clique.
The stance of the north clique is closer to official thinking and their opinions are usually tougher.  During certain phases in history and also in important political events, they are more often to show their hostile and exceedingly pressing stand.
In the south clique, their Taiwan research institutions are mostly located on the south side of Yangzi River, including Shanghai and Fujian etc.
Japanese media revealed that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's "academic record" of "two years study in London" is an exaggeration.
Japan's "Shukan Post" has verified with the registrar of University of London -- Koizumi attended several classes as a non-credit earning student and stayed there for only nine months.  He did not receive any academic degree.
This scandal was widely reported and republished by large and small media across China.  The news is most gratifying to the vast majority of compatriots.
Indeed, even the prime minister of a country has fabricated academic record to cheat the people of his country.
It is especially shameful when it happens in an "imperialism" country like Japan.
However, if we can change our angle, we may be able to see some positive meanings from this scandal.
Furthermore, these kind of positive things are very often what we lack and are also what we need to perfect urgently.
In recent years, we have been advocating "integrity" and we want to "forge a government-in-sunshine", improve the "transparency" of government administration, and respect the public's "right to know".  However, the reality is still very far from ideal.
Try and think.  The diploma of a country's prime minister is "fabricated".  After all, it is really not a very big issue but the fact that it can be revealed and pursued by media does indicate something.
In a country like that, is there still anything that cannot be "in-sunshine"?
In Taiwan's evening election rallies, different camps usually use tourist buses to pick up a large mass of people to the campaign site.  However, the recent trend is that evening rallies of Bian-Lu have become quieter than those of Lien-Soong.
Not long ago, Taiwan president Chen Shui-bian held a campaign rally in a certain northern city.  He was shouting "Dong Suan (homonym of 'win an election')" but about half of the crowd in front of the stage did not follow him -- it turns out that most of the crowd have friends invested in Mainland China but the three direct links are delayed again and again; the economic policy does not produce results and many feel uncomfortable.
If there is no accident, judging from different signs ranging from public survey to illegal betting over the election result, the defeat of Chen-Lu pair can be presumed as the presidential election enters the phase of final countdown.
Unless there is an outburst of some explosive circumstances, for example, the Pan-Blue Coalition has a major spilt or even more embarrassing scandal, otherwise Chen Shui-bian, who came to power through secret support of Lee Teng-hui, has proven incapable of wining enough support from the public over the past four years.  In fact, the confidence of Pan-Green supporters was weakened because the Pan-Green Coalition has continuously exposed their inadequacy in the black gold corruption and a series of no-taste roles or performance.
How should Beijing look at the situation where Pan-Blue Coalition may regain power again?
First, we should understand the Pan-Blue Coalition that may regain power is no longer controlled solely by Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) but a combination of Kuomintang and the People First Party.  There will be problems of internal tradition and collaboration with local parties.
The current close cooperation during the election period may not necessarily indicate the relation in future.
If they do win the election, they are going to need a lot of time for internal reorganization in order to face the legislative election following heel at the end of the year.  This means it is difficult for the Lien-Soong regime to make any important changes to the cross-strait relation.
Unless they can recognize the improvement of cross-strait relation can help gain some bonus points in Taiwan internal politics and are confident that they can create fruitful results in a short period of time.  In any event, the most important thing is to be able to let the people of Taiwan taste that fruitful result.
Given this background, Beijing should slow down the unification action and gives the leaders of the "traditional Pan-Blue Coalition" more time to consolidate internal affairs.
It has been more than half of a century since United States' first nuclear explosion test in New Mexico in July 1945 and two atomic bombs were thrown into Japan in August the same year.
The arms race between the two super powers of U.S. and Russia had caused the accumulation of nuclear weapons to the extent sufficient for the destruction of the entire world.  It is fortunate that both sides recognize the destructive power of a nuclear war and had never pressed the nuclear button.
After the disintegration of Soviet Union, the world moved into a post-Cold War period and the danger of a large-scale nuclear war was basically eliminated.
Meanwhile, the danger of nuclear proliferation has not decreased but actually increased.
The proliferation has appeared in two areas.
On one hand, certain countries of medium size or above that possess considerable resources and strength have made every effort to produce or acquire nuclear weapons in order to satisfy their objective to dominate a region, to compete with a neighbor country, to maintain security or for extortions in their foreign affairs.
In other cases, certain organizations or groups that are not nations, especially those Islamic extremists with strong hatred to western world, are also making every effort to acquire small nuclear weapons in order to carry out bloody terrorist activities against the west and will not hesitate to harm a large group of innocent civilians.
Under such demand, brokers for the purchase or sale of nuclear weapons and the transfer of related technology have emerged and the "nuclear black market" was found and flourishing.  This has become an important component of nuclear proliferation in our world at this time.
As a descendant of the yellow Emperor born and brought up in Jiahu, Hangzhou, I can still remember the rural scenery and the living of the rural population on the south side of the river in the old days.
I finally return to my hometown after separation for years.  Along the Shanghai-Hangzhou freeway, I found many three-storey buildings built by farmers were embellishing here and there in those eye filling green color farmlands.  However, I saw only very few people working on the land.
This is really amazing to me.  For someone born here but has been sentimentally attached to a foreign country far from home, it is difficult to believe this kind of changes.
Recently, I feel unexpected and shocked when I saw some reportage and on-site survey reports about China's rural villages on the Internet.
It is just beyond ordinary imagination that there are still so many dark sides in China's rural villages.  The Chinese peasants are still living in poverty, a difficult and humiliating life without rights.
After on-site survey in the three provinces of Anhui, Henan and Hebei, the couple of Chen Guidi is appealing for farmers and they have compiled a lengthy reportage, entitled "A Survey about Chinese Peasantry".  The report has brought shock waves to the Chinese society.
There were numerous instances of farmers being squeezed by corrupted officials or even killed.  The conclusion that one can draw: we feel an unprecedented shock and secret anguish when we walk near the Chinese farmers.  We can see the kind of poverty, crime, helplessness, resistance, silence and sorrow that you can never imagine.
These are words of deep sorrow and extreme grief.
As expected, Malaysia Prime Minister Abdullah dissolved parliament the day before yesterday and the election for a new government will be held in the near future.
To Abdullah, this election has a great significance to his political career.  To Malaysia's political situation and development trend, the result of this election is also of landmark importance.
Abdullah took over the leadership from Mahathir in November last year, in other words, only four months ago.
Notwithstanding that, he still decided to dissolve parliament and advance the date of the poll.
This contains at least two types of meaning: one, Abdullah is satisfied with his own political performance in the past four months and has full confidence with intentions of voters; second, he wishes to use the poll to consolidate his power base such that he can move out from the shadow of Mahathir.
Without doubt, Abdullah's decision to hold a lightning election reflects that he has already completed a comprehensive assessment of the political situation in Malaysia.
The current economic situation in Malaysia is quite good and it is not likely that the opposition can use this topic to attack the government.
Moreover, Abdullah has adopted some high-profile measures against corruption ever since his took over office, including the arrest and prosecution of former Lands and Cooperative Development Minister Kasitah.  These moves have won some favorable views and the public are looking forward optimistically for more actions on anti-corruption.
Meanwhile, he has urged to improve the efficiency in civil services, which is another move that inspired people.
Since the day European Union (EU) was formed, it has grown up and shaped under strong influence of French politics and culture.
In foreign affairs, EU strives for independence and autonomy.  Its stance to world affairs and its approach to issues are different from that of United States.  This is the direction of EU's foreign policy and we can see an obvious shadow of France from it.
Because of this, international community, including China, Russia and Arabian countries, wishes to see a rise of EU such that a totally independent force in international relationship can be seen.
We must admit EU has strived to follow this direction in its foreign policy since the late eighties.
In December 1992, the heads of EU have agreed unanimously in the Maastricht summit that all member countries will carry out a unified foreign policy such that they can say the same words to outsiders.
However, the "unified foreign policy" faced the first complete defeat when EU had to deal with the Bosnia problem two years later.
Since the Maastricht summit ten years ago, we may say that EU's foreign affairs have nothing good or unusual to report.
More important, EU's foreign policy cannot go through major tests in important events.
This is proved by the different stands adopted by member countries in the U.S.-Iraq war.  It once again revealed the fatal defects of EU politics and that is, EU can be easily split up by another big country and be crushed one by one.
Bush announced in White House on February 24 that he supports a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage.
This is an obvious change from his ambiguous stance on the issue in the past several months and represents an important political development in a U.S. election year.
This constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage is a very powerful political weapon in southern United States, an emerging stronghold for Republicans.  However, it also has a great negative effect because it is a heavy weight cultural contention nation-wide that spilt up public opinion.  Without doubt, the move will accelerate the polarization of U.S. politics and goes a step further from the freedom school of thought that dominates the east and west coast.
In the 2000 election, Bush has kept on saying that he supports "unity" and is not a "separatist" but obviously his words and deeds are not in accord.
Furthermore, the younger generation in U.S. is adopting an increasingly opened stand on the homosexual issue.  Bush's movement may have a short-term effect but could harm the long-term interest of Republicans.
Bush's new offensive in form of "constitutional amendment" may be called a "scorched earth strategy" for the presidential election this year.
Bush is pursuing this tactic because he is slipping into an increasingly weak position in the "war on terrorism" and the issue of economy-employment.  He has no choice but to start a new front line on religion and culture that split domestic opinions.
U.S. is showing a cautious attitude up till now.
That is to say, the maintenance of the current status in Taiwan Straits can satisfy U.S. long-term objective of having a strategic check and balance on Mainland China. Therefore, U.S. is trying to avoid political or military conflicts with China because of any encouragement to Taiwan independence.
One can easily imagine, U.S. will not comply totally with Beijing's demand and completely eliminate the space for a poll in Taiwan.  However, based on consideration of its own interests, U.S. may make some warnings in advance.
Recently, U.S. Secretary of State Powell has reiterated the U.S. established Taiwan policy on his own initiative and expressly stated U.S. stance against Taiwan independence.
Outsiders have interpreted the declaration of stands as a signal to Chen Shui-bien that he should keep things within limits and prevent him from totally possessed by the Devil.
Some think tanks with governmental background in U.S. have also made some comments recently.  U.S. has also sent a large batch of spy ships to the Taiwan Straits to detect military movements in both sides of the Taiwan Strait.  These actions indirectly indicated U.S. is paying close attention to the status in Taiwan Strait.
Despite U.S. will not comply with Beijing's demand and stop the polls in Taiwan, it does indicate from another angle that U.S. is also worrying about the uncertainties in the situation of Taiwan Strait in this period of time.
Any large scale one man, one vote polls, there can only be one type of result -- either Chen Shui-bien renews his office by luck or Lien Chan will re-enter Taiwan's presidential palace.
The worrying part is that it appears all circles in the society of Mainland are not psychologically ready for a possible victory of Chen Shui-bien because of the imbalance in information dissemination.
If the poll result is not as desire, it may cause Beijing to fall into an unnecessary passive situation again.
An old Arab proverb says, "a thousand years of tyranny being better than one day of anarchy".
Is this what is worrying the countries in northeastern Asia?
I think the answer is probably yes.
A famous research and development center closed to Washington and funded by U.S. government has recently conducted a study to explore the four possible choices against North Korea's nuclear crisis and they are: relationship, stonewalling, economic sanction and preemptive strike.
The focus of the study is the position adopted by different countries to these strategies.
Furthermore, the study also tries to analyze the threat imposed by North Korea's nuclear weapon plan according to people's fear in neighboring countries, their belief of a probably nuclear attack and the possible damage.
China and Russia feel that the danger of North Korea using its nuclear weapon is low or very low but the people of Japan and South Korea believe the threat is rather high.
All northeastern countries in Asia are in favor of maintaining a relation with North Korea.
Japan supports stonewalling and some other countries also accept the strategy of stonewalling under some specific situation.
Singapore cares very much about its international ranking and, throughout the year, it keeps on monitoring all kinds of country ranking lists compiled by various U.S. and European institutions.
As we are so often at the top, our interests in these rankings have naturally increased.
However, there is also a lot of trouble for being in the first place in so many areas.
Most people in our country feel that if we pay too much attention to rankings, it may indicate our fear of losing.  If we emphasize these rankings, it may indicate we are too proud of ourselves.
Therefore, people said we should care less for these things and the best thing is to hold oneself aloof from the world.
Many people did not care about ranking in the past and hence, an intriguing phenomenon has appeared: people do not take "number one in the world" as good news but are more inclined to take it as an embarrassing issue.
Nevertheless, the situation has changed completely in the past one or two years.
We started to have doubts about our country's long-term competitiveness and people in all trades and profession are worrying about the stability of their jobs.
Under such doubts, people are no longer talking that generously.
International competition is fierce.  If you do not care enough, other people may overtake you.  When you are first in everything, it becomes easy to fall behind in something.
On the face of it, Bush has expressed personal loyalty towards Cheney.  In the Republican governors meeting at the end of last month, Bush still pledged in all sincerity and seriousness that Cheney is the only choice for vice president.
However, he also said in a half joking way that he has already appointed Cheney to look for a vice president candidate just like that in 2000.
The low profile, low key Cheney has recently appeared frequently in media interviews and denied that he will be replaced.
However, he also left himself a graceful way to back out.
He said if his health becomes a problem or he feels he is a burden to the president, he could understand the difficulty and withdraw on his own.
Cheney is 63 years old and has suffered four heart attacks.
It is widely rumored that U.S. troops has actually tightly surrounded the mastermind of September 11, Osama.  U.S. is waiting for the ripe time to make the easy capture.
The presidential election is to be held on November 2 and the pentagon is preparing for a good play to take Osama alive in October.
However, a long delay may mean many hitches.  There can be no end of trouble in the future if Osama slips through by chance.
It looks that Giuliani is a safer trump card for Bush to win votes.
The contenders for the 2004 U.S. presidential election have been confirmed: Democratic candidate Kerry challenges the Republican President Bush.
They have both commenced some "warm-up activities" for the November election including advertising campaign and debates etc.
They will probably argue orally and in writing on the three major issues of war, economy and society.
Bush believes war has a close relation to U.S. national security.  He has sent soldiers to overthrow Saddam, fights terrorism and these are all for U.S. security.  That is why he keeps on telling Americans, "We are in the middle of a war".
Kerry will naturally point out Bush's wrongdoing of abusing incorrect intelligence on weapons of mass destruction to launch a war against Iraq.
On the economic front, Kerry thinks Bush's tax cuts benefit the rich but cannot create new jobs.
Bush will ask Kerry to see: is the economic data in U.S. going up at this time?
On social problems, if we look at men and women relation, Bush opposes same sex marriage, opposes abortion and supports death penalty.  Kerry also opposes same sex marriage but supports abortion and opposes death penalty.
It is all about how Bush and Kerry can express their own views on the three major issues and convince voters through advertisement, television and speeches.  Those are the political shows that the two have to perform in the next 8 months.
However, Kerry has more room to show his talent in the area of foreign affairs.
According to statistics, young people who selected to commit suicide are mostly in the age of 15 to 19, and quite a number of them were actually only 10 - 14 years old.
The general belief is that stress in studies could be a leading factor for children and youth to commit suicide.  Nevertheless, research discovers that sentimental issues, especially love affairs between male and female, as well as their get along with parents, is the main factor for local youth to commit suicide.
The stress on studies and deviation from expectation are naturally also an area of communication between children and parents.
The stress of moving up to college has been a burden for a long-time to local students during their growth and development period.  Sometimes, stress is self-imposed but often parents impose the stress to children.
Parents demand their children to have good academic results.  They frequently compare their children with other children and demand their children to work harder.  This will obviously create great stress to children.  However, it is really the channel of communication and guidance behind the stress that is the real thermometer for measuring parent and children relation.
If a child is not performing as desired and parents beat or scold the child, use facial expression as a silent reproach or even make the child feel guilty of oneself, this will no doubt push the child to a desperate helpless situation.
It is understood that the spiritual distress of many young students requiring counsel was caused by unrealistic expectation of their parents, which pushes students into dead corners.
Due to Singapore's success and rapid development, parents feel their children have much better material conditions than themselves.  They naturally believe their children should have better performance than themselves.
Parents usually forget their own performance in various areas is not that outstanding when they were kids themselves.
At the age of 1-1/2, the majority of our children will be sent to childcare centers with full care services.  The authority only charges a nominal fee for such service.  Most children go home only one day in a week or sometimes even one day in a month.
Today, Singapore is facing the social problem of a low birth rate and an aging society.
The young generation is busy in maintaining their modern living standard and their enjoyment of life-style materialism.  They do not even have enough time to take care of themselves.  Hence, they could not possibly have enough energy to support the government's call for early marriage and more children.
The author has a bold suggestion: the government should take over all newborn children.
Citizens of our nation only need to think about giving birth to children but not raising them.
On one hand, the government can operate childcare centers and kindergartens of full care style.  Primary schools can be converted to a full-day system and may even include service for three meals.  The government will only charge a nominal fee affordable to our citizens.
This will create jobs for the unemployed in our population and the government need not worry about the effectiveness of different measures like child bonus, increase in duration of maternity leave, the quality of maids and tax rebates etc.
What Beijing needs to do is not only to play a leading role in the six-party talks but also keeps in mind China's long-term interest in the Korean Peninsula.  It is always better to repair the house before it rains and so, Beijing should unfold its strategic deployment as soon as possible.
In specific terms, on one hand, Beijing has to urge North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapon.  On the other hand, it has to induce a reform on Kim Jong-Il regime and guides North Korea to the road of modern civilization.  This removes the danger of a nuclear war in northeastern Asia and could also become chips for long-term strategic dealings with U.S.
Pyongyang is fierce of mien but faint of heart.  Deep inside Pyongyang's mind, it is longing for economic development and the opportunity to blend into international community.
It is only that its wishes are frequently expressed in external forms that are valiant, irrational and sometimes totally against international rules.
In fact for quite some time, Beijing has been using its influences and economic aid measures to force Pyongyang to change its stand of not complying with international rules.
This kind of action obviously needs an all-round planning.
Beijing's assistance to Pyongyang should not be limited to the economic layer but can be extended to other areas in the society.  Beijing should not limit itself to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear plan but also guide Pyongyang to the route of modern civilization.
When John Kelly first entered the arena, nobody is betting on him.  At that time, all focuses were on former Vermont governor Dean.
However, Kelly has sudden emerged as a new force before the Iowa caucus in January.  He won the primary or caucus in two most critical states in one blow -- Iowa and New Hampshire.
Basically, Kelly has not missed in any primaries in other states afterwards.  For those states that he missed, it was because those states already had their own candidates.
Kelly has only used six weeks and turned from a candidate with almost no future to the final candidate.  All of his competitors including Gephardt, Lieberman, Clark, Dean and Edwards have fallen out one by one.  People cannot help but to treat Kelly's political charisma with increased respect.
Throughout his 19 years career as a senator, Kelly supports abortion and environmental protection.  He opposes tax cuts that benefits the rich and strives to raise the minimum wage.  He also hopes to solve the global warming issue.
His working experience in Washington shows that he is willing to face difficult problems in the society, bold enough to challenge authoritativeness, thorough pursuance of value and is not afraid of offending the interests of a small group of people.
China's reform and opening policy started from agriculture and rural residents are the early beneficiaries of this policy.
However, the economic policy has leaned greatly towards cities since the nineties and the reform in agriculture has come to a stand still.  The gap between city and rural areas has widened.
As time progress, there are two different worlds in China.  On one hand, we have the highly prosperous cities and on the other hand, the rural villages are backward and in poverty.
Using the words of Chinese officials, the widening gap between rich cities and poor villages is a "problem during the course of development".  It has to be solved through sustained development.
In other words, China's coastal regions and cities should continue with development and need not be dragged down by the problem in rural villages.
However, when people see that cities can have a small change in one year and a major change in three years, they cannot help but ask: why is there no change at all in some poor regions over the past several decades?
Of course, the development path for cities and rural villages is quite different.  This is a fact that we have to admit.  But, the problem is that we have put a large amount of capital into city development.  We encourage and support the rich middle class.  At the same time, does the rural population, which accounts for 70% of the nation's population, receive the care and importance they deserve?
In theory, we cannot say the past administrations of the Chinese government did not attach importance to agriculture, rural villages and farmers.
However, the situation in rural villages has turn worst and becomes increasingly difficult in recent years.  This has illustrated the degree of importance attached is clear not enough.
Public security, Procuratorate and judiciary should be images of fair and justice in any country and is also the most important system to protect social stability.
Unfortunately, public security, procuratorate and judiciary have become images of corruption in China.
According to the report by China's National Audit Office, the result of an examination on financial expenditures in public security institutions in 26 province / city showed that spending against regulation amounted to RMB 16.5 billion across the nation.
The result makes it open that the distrust in public security, procuratorate and judiciary has reached a crisis state.
The Liu Yong case, the Sun Zhigang case and the latest "BMW" case in Heilong Jiang have all reflected the profound distrust.
The "BMW" incident is a typical case.
The close attention to the case has far exceeded the attention to "SARS" during the "SARS" crisis period because people are so much concerned about the issue.
In fact, people are not caring about the "BMW" incident itself.  People are expressing their distrust to the whole judiciary system.
The related departments understand this clearly and they have taken measures to shut up the media soon afterwards.
However, the problem is still there.
The second round six-party talks on Korean Peninsula nuclear issue has ended in a way as many have expected.
In this meeting, the related parties have made contacts and probes on surrounding issues to the Korean Peninsula nuclear crisis.  They have also reached the common consensus to set up a working group before the third round of talks, which is to be held before the end of June this year.
However, there was no progress at all in the meeting as to how North Korea would abandon its nuclear weapon research program, or how United States would guarantee North Korea's political and military safety after it abandoned the nuclear program, or other practical issue like energy aid etc.  In fact, it only gives people the impression that the "deadlock" has been tightened further.
The two important figures -- North Korea and United States have not made any concession and the fundamental position of the both sides have not changed a bit.
Nevertheless, the conspicuous point is that U.S. does not show any desire for a fast resolution of the problem in this meeting but rather gives people the impression of "dragging" on.
This kind of U.S. policy is obviously related to the latest development in international situations and the benefits that U.S. attempts to gain from these latest developments.
There have never been so many bosses of corporations thrown into jail in America ever since the time when Roosevelt was president.
Is this a coincidence or is that the public and investors can no longer tolerate illegal and criminal corporate activities in the last three years and thus, causing these crimes be revealed recently one after the other?
There is no simple answer to that.  However, it is a fact that many illegal corporate activities were revealed recently.
This is good for economic recovery and especially a good sign in the restoration of investor confidence.
The end of the nineties may be the most disorderly period in the history of U.S. commerce and also the most difficult phase to understand.  Hence, the earlier its impact is gone, the better.
Once the dust settles, some corporate names may vanish from history and could only be found in college textbooks in commerce.
New management teams are leading some other companies, for example, Tyco and MCI, and they are trying their best to reposition themselves to meet the challenges in a new round of economic growth.
But, when will a new round of economic growth arrive?
As a CEO, you may not have the answer.
This is not important though, because even the Chairman of U.S. Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan does not know the answer.
The Bush administration is trying to use Keynes philosophy to stimulate the economy, which calls for massive increase in spending (especially in defense spending) on one hand and massive tax cuts on the other hand.
In international affairs, the Bush administration continues to promote free trade but trade deficits have already reached a new high of US$549 billion.
After the massive tax cuts, investments and consumption did not show any remarkable growth.
The new Keynes school of thought represented by famous British economist, Wyme Godley, believe U.S. economy is mired in difficulties and Bush's fiscal and economic strategy is unable to save the situation.
They believe the so-called "market discipline to command" is only an illusion which inevitably benefits a few while putting the vast majority into an unfavorable situation.
In the past, most people believe the benefited in our world are a few in U.S. while those in an unfavorable situation are the vast number in developing countries.
Nowadays, that is not the fact.
Apart from those multinational companies based in U.S., many U.S. economists believe that India and China are the notable winners in the current globalization process.
India dominates the service economy sector while China dominates the manufacturing area.
While people concentrate their attention on the phenomenon of massive shift in U.S. capital and production equipment to China, they fail to see the advantage of a high quality, low-income labor market in China.
First, is the current situation in Taiwan within or outside the expectation of Beijing?
Obviously, Beijing's expectation is only known to Beijing itself.  However, other people can deliberate Beijing's assessment results using other public information.
In the past four years, the camp led by Chen Shui-bian and Lu Hsiu-lien has been actively promoting Taiwan independence using clear-cut language and ruthless efforts.
To the contrary, Beijing has only made occasional protests but, other than that, its response became quite a routine procedure and appeared indifferent to the progress of Taiwan independence.
Since autumn last year, the situation suddenly changed completely.  It appears as if a cow cart has suddenly turned into a motorcar.  Over the past few months, its handling capability is obviously different from that in the nineties.
Based on this, we can speculate the current situation in Taiwan is within Beijing's expectation.
Second, we can look at foreign affairs involving Taiwan.
Regarding the situation in Taiwan Strait, we need to see whether the position of major countries, for example, United States etc. is closer to Beijing or closer to Taipei.
The stands of these countries are opened and clear.  Therefore, the answer is obvious.
Up till now, these countries are getting closer to Beijing and have more specific associations.  On the other hand, these countries are getting further away from Taipei and specific associations are fewer than before.  Furthermore, some "sincere words and earnest wishes" started to appear to the much-praised democracy in Taiwan.
Bahraini Princess Marries US Soldier, Astonishing 5-Year Bond Comes to End
The star-crossed marriage between Bahraini princess Meriam Al-Khalifa and US marine Johnson was once extensively feted on US television. However, it has come to an end in the desert gambling town of Las Vegas after only five years.
Meriam is a member of the Gulf country Bahrain's royal family. Johnson risked his army career over their forbidden love affair, Their fairy-tale marriage became the subject of a television movie.
But the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that after only five years, the couple is headed to the court after Meriam filed for divorce in the gambling town known for its quickie marriages and even quicker dissolutions.
The pair met in 1999 when career military man Johnson was stationed in Bahrain.
But his life changed dramatically when he met the beautiful teenage princess and the pair fell in love.
Their union was forbidden by the royal family, so Johnson disguised Meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap, forged her military identification papers and brought her out of her home country to America.
After a bitter immigration battle with US authorities, the couple finally married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the famed and glitzy Las Vegas Strip when Johnson was 23 and the bride only 19.
However, Johnson says that their star-crossed union comes to an end because of the temptations of the "Sin City" of Las Vegas, the constant tensions with Meriam's rich and powerful family and rumors of an assassination plot against him.
Johnson says his work was to park the cars of hotel and casino guests while Meriam was increasingly tempted by the nightlife of the gambling city, frequenting clubs late at night and ignoring her husband.
Meriam abandoned her husband a year ago.
"She's gone off the deep end," Johnson says.
This Week's Eurozone Economic Indicators to Show Continuous Economic Weakening in Europe
Economists said that Eurozone economic indicators to be released this week will provide further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output, while British data is expected to show a pick-up in industrial activities.
They said economic output data from the largest Eurozone countries will continue to be volatile from one month to the next, but the longer-term trend of output will point to slowing economic growth.
The most important economic indicators of the week will be in Germany, where the ZEW institute's economic expectations index, which is due on the 7th and is closely watched by the market, will offer Europe its first evidence of economic confidence in December.
The ZEW index fell sharply to 13.9 in November from 31.3 the previous month.
Economists said the significant appreciation of the Euro will have continued to weigh on economic confidence in the latest survey, so there is no reason to expect any rebound in the economic expectations index.
"Given that the main factors driving down economic confidence, including the Euro's appreciation, uncertainty over global growth and the weak labor market and worsening unemployment in Germany, have remained a drag on future growth expectations over the December survey period, a strong rebound is unlikely," BNP's economists said.
According to a survey among economists conducted by AFX News, the AFP financial news subsidiary, the index will drop again to 11.0 in December from 13.9 in the previous month.
However, Teather of UBS investment bank said Germany's ZEW economic expectations index could drop as far as zero in December.
"Expectations of future German economic activity, as reflected in the ZEW survey of analysts and financial market participants, will continue to fall in our view," said Teather.
Ukraine Crisis Causing Tensions between East and West to Dominate OSCE Meeting
Russia has been accusing the West of interfering in the affairs of Eastern Europe, which has gradually become a focus due to the political crisis in Ukraine and is expected to top the agenda of the annual ministerial meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which will open tomorrow.
Russia is irritated by the creeping influence of the West into corners of Europe it previously considered its backyard, like the Baltic states, Georgia and central Asia. As a result, the recent incident in Ukraine is likely to dominate the discussions of the two-day OSCE meeting in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia.
Ukraine's Supreme Court has made a dramatic ruling to order a re-voting of the recent second-round presidential election. And before this, the European Union had called on member states of the OSCE to ask their observers to get ready for "the quickest and efficient actions".
According to European sources, the number of OSCE observers will increase to 1,000 from the original 600 in Ukraine's re-election scheduled for December 26th.
US Secretary of State Powell will attend OSCE's annual meeting, which is perhaps his last foreign tour before leaving office.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, French Foreign Minister Barnier, British Foreign Minister Straw and German Foreign Minister Fischer will also be attending the meeting.
The OSCE groups the 55 states of North America, Europe and Asia. It will celebrate the 30th anniversary of its founding next year.
The organization was established at the Helsinki conference, which helped end the Cold War.
Bush's Major Test: Intelligence Reform Bill to Face Congressional Vote this Week
The intelligence reform bill the US congress will take efforts to pass this week is part of an ambitious second-term agenda pushed by Republican President Bush, whose support level among Republican congressmen will be his first major test after re-election.
In a newspaper interview yesterday, Kean, the Republican who led the investigation into the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, said the issue with the intelligence reform bill was that it has to be passed by the Congress and that the matter itself augurs ill for bipartisan cooperation and the president's domestic agenda.
"Congress becomes dysfunctional if the president and Congress can't get these big issues taken care of, and then we're all in trouble," Kean said.
"It'll be a long time before there's another bill with the support of the Republican and Democratic leadership in both houses and the support of 80% of the American people in the polls," he told The New York Daily News.
Several lawmakers said yesterday that failure of the groundbreaking reform bill could delay overhaul of America's antiquated spy network by months, years or kill it altogether.
The top Democrat on the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee, Harman, yesterday told CNN television that "if the bill isn't passed this week, it dies".
Congress will try again on the 6th and 7th to pass the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 before adjourning until early next year.
If lawmakers fail, the entire bill will be discarded and need to be rewritten in the Congress' 2005 session.
Ukraine's Opposition Strongly Opposes Large Constitutional Amendment to Dilute Presidential Powers
Ukraine's pro-West opposition firmly insisted today that they would not accept the constitutional reform pushed by outgoing Ukrainian President Kuchma before the second round presidential re-election.
The constitutional reform will dilute most of the president's powers.
With the November 21st vote declared invalid by the Supreme Court because of massive vote fraud in the second-round presidential elections and a new date of re-election set by the Central Election Commission for December 26, opposition leader Yushchenko is locked in a fresh standoff with Kuchma.
"If the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form, all the powers of the president would be transferred to the parliament. This would be unacceptable," said Timoshenko, an ally of Yushchenko.
"We want the president to be able to name the head of the intelligence agency and the prosecutor general so we can fight corruption and get rid of the clans that dominate Ukraine's political and business life," she told reporters.
Kuchma, who keeps close ties to Russia, had pushed for constitutional changes before the re-election amid fears that the opposition could win the presidential election.
Opposition lawmakers yesterday refused to vote for government-proposed constitutional changes and the parliament adjourned for 10 days.
According to the constitutional amendment, the power to appoint all top posts excepting the prime minister, defense and foreign ministers would be transferred from the president to the parliament, where pro-government forces currently have close to a majority.
According to the amendment, the president's nominees for the prime minister, defense and foreign ministers would need to be approved by lawmakers, who could also put forward their own candidates.
Ukraine's Political Crisis Enters Third Week with Opposition Calling for Continuous Protest
The chaos caused by Ukraine's presidential election has entered its third week. Opposition leader Yushchenko today called on his supporters to continue the street protests and block the presidential palace and government buildings unless outgoing President Kuchma dismisses Prime Minister Yanukovych and his cabinet members and takes actions to ensure the fairness of the upcoming presidential reelection.
Tens of thousands of Yushchenko's supporters have gathered in the capital of Kiev for two weeks, blocking the government buildings and encamping themselves on major avenues designed by Soviet experts to hold military parades. The people power they have demonstrated has forced the Supreme Court to annul the second round of presidential election of December 21st and the Central Election Commission to order a reelection for December 26th. The parliament has approved the dismissal of Yanukovych, but Kuchma, Yanukovych's mentor, has not signed the administrative decree to fire his successor.
Yushchenko told supporters gathered at the capital's Independence Square this evening that Kuchma should dismiss his government, and reshuffle the Central Election Commission. In addition, both the parliament and Kuchma should agree to amend the election law to prevent election fraud.
"Before these decisions are made, the issue of blockade on government buildings and the presidential palace will not be discussed," he said, starting his campaign for the December 26 election.
"Over the past 14 days, the square has shown the love for Ukraine and the civil consciousness of millions of Ukrainian people who can defend their own choice."
"We are undergoing a fight between good and evil. The world is applauding our victory and is proud of Ukraine," he said.
As the opposition is putting more pressure on the ruling authority backed by Moscow and Yushchenko and Kuchma are once again locked in a standoff of constitutional reform, Polish President Kwasniewski, Lithuanian President Adamkus and Russian envoy Gryszlov are scheduled to arrive in Kiev on the 6th for another round of mediation.
Egypt Announces Breakthrough in Stalled Middle East Peace Process
Egypt says a new framework is expected to come into being for the Middle East peace agreement.
It also says it is likely to return its ambassador to Israel in the near future to restore the full diplomatic ties severed four years ago.
Quoting "high-level" Egyptian sources, Egypt's state news agency, the Middle East News Agency (MENA), said parties in the search for a peace plan have gradually reached an understanding that could lead to a comprehensive reconciliation.
"An important understanding has been reached by Egypt, Israel, the Palestinians and the significant international parties, such as the United States and the European Union, agreeing in principle on a comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," MENA said.
Following the death last month of veteran Palestinian leader Arafat, the international community has revitalized its efforts to advance towards a final Middle East peace policy in a bid to end at an early date years of bloody conflict between Israel and Palestine.
MENA said officials expect that "preparations would take place until July, after which political action will begin".
MENA said it will be followed by a conference in Washington attended by all parties concerned with the peace process, notably Israel and Palestine, as well as Egypt, the United States, Russia and several European countries.
Topics of the meeting are expected to include a "bilateral ceasefire" and the Palestinian Authority "putting a stop to anti-Israeli attacks and consolidating its control over the situation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank."
For this point, MENA said Israeli Prime Minister Sharon has promised to "stop Israeli military operations against the Palestinians insofar as they continue to respect the ceasefire deal and control their territory."
One Billion Children Suffer from War, Poverty and AIDS
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) pointed out today in its annual report that more than 1 billion children, half of the world's population of children, suffer from poverty, war and the scourge of AIDS.
UNICEF says the rights of children to a healthy and protected upbringing, as laid out in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, are regularly imperiled, due in part to the failure of governments to carry out human rights and economic reforms.
UNICEF Executive Director Bellamy pointed out during the release of the report in London that "when half the world's children are growing up hungry and unhealthy, when schools have become targets of attacks and whole villages are being emptied by AIDS, we've failed to deliver on the promise of childhood".
"Too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually hurt childhood," Bellamy added.
UNICEF has joined hands with researchers from Britain's London School of Economics and Bristol University to compile statistics which paint a terrible portrait of children at risk in most part of the world.
Researchers have found that around 640 million children lack adequate shelter, 400 million have no access to safe water, 270 million have no access to health care services and 140 million (mostly girls) have never been to school in the world.
Researchers point out that even worse is that at least 700 million children suffer from various forms of "severe deprivation", which also includes a lack of access to information and public sanitation facilities.
The 10th annual UNICEF report released today points out that war and AIDS have destroyed networks that normally protect children and at times turned them into direct victims of war and AIDS.
EU Resists Chinese Pressure to Lift Arms Embargo
The European Union today rebuffed pressure for a quick end to the arms embargo on China from Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, but said it was working towards lifting the 15-year-old ban.
The EU Dutch presidency made the remarks following a China-EU summit.
The Netherlands says it cannot speculate how the EU will end the embargo.
The EU imposed the arms ban on Beijing after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
Although the arms embargo overshadowed the China-EU summit, the two sides have signed several trade and other agreements.
Both China and the EU claim that such deals have strengthened their "strategic partnership".
"The EU side has confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo," said the EU in a joint statement made after the summit with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.
The statement points out that the Chinese delegation "welcomes the positive signal and considers it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and the EU."
Wen Jiabao didn't hide his displeasure at a press conference following the summit. He said the ban "does not reflect the partnership between China and the EU".
"The embargo is a result of the Cold War and does not reflect the present situation nor the partnership between China and the EU," Wen Jiabao said.
A group of EU countries led by France is pushing for the arms ban to be lifted, saying the ban is outdated.
But some in the EU worry that without a strengthened set of EU rules, a lifting of the embargo could open the floodgates to arms sales which could improve China's military strength.
"I have explained that the EU is willing to lift the embargo but I also must say that this is related to adjustments of the code of conduct on arms exports," said Dutch Prime Minister Balkenende.
Preliminary Research Finds Folic Acid May Be Linked to Breast Cancer But Link Not Confirmed
A new health study points out that folic acid, a B vitamin widely taken by pregnant women to protect against birth defects, has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.
But the researchers say their results could merely be the result of chance, as other studies have suggested that folic acid actually reduces the risk of breast cancer, so they urge pregnant women to continue taking the supplement.
Folic acid, found naturally in dark, leafy vegetables, is known to be a key aid in the growth of the fetus.
Researchers from the universities of Bristol and Aberdeen followed 3,000 women who in the 1960s were given supplements of either five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folate, or a placebo, mostly during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
The study published in the British Medical Journal says that by September 2002, breast cancer rates were twice as high for those who took the five-milligram supplement as for those who took the placebo.
One of the researchers, Ness, has stressed the results were merely "preliminary¡­ intended to point the way towards further research".
"It's entirely possible that this is a chance finding, so further scientific studies are required to examine the association, if there is one, before we reach any conclusions," he said.
Ness says women planning to become pregnant should still take folic acid supplements.
He says there is a "considerable difference between the trial" and current dosage recommendations.
According to British health guidelines, women hoping to become pregnant and those in the first trimester of their pregnancy should take a 0.4-microgram daily supplement of folic acid šC more than 10 times smaller than the doses given to women in the study.
Two Candidates in Widely Different Mood as Ukraine Holds Presidential Re-election
The two rivals set to meet in Ukraine's presidential re-election on the 26th this month have got ready for the runoff.
The pro-West opposition leader Yushchenko is confident of wining the election while the pro-Moscow incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovych says he will no longer represent the "shameful" ruling party in the election.
Meanwhile, Russian President Putin has changed his attitude towards Ukraine's entry into the European Union, saying he supports its entry into the EU.
Asked how many votes he would garner in the re-election, Yushchenko told a crowded press conference, "Conservatively speaking, I should win around 60% of the votes."
On the other hand, Yanukovych, looking anxious and upset from his appearance, directly dodged answering reporters' questions several times, saying at last, "For God's will, we will win."
Yanukovych, who was originally chosen as a successor of incumbent President Kuchma, has changed his mind and positioned himself as a rival candidate against both the opposition and the ruling parties.
"I used to trust those cowards and traitors working with the government but I'm very disappointed now. The government is shameful," he said almost directly giving the names.
Kuchma and the opposition reached a compromise to transfer part of the presidential powers to the parliament by amending the law to end two weeks of massive opposition protests and political chaos since the presidential election on November 21st.
Yanukovych's victory in the election has been declared invalid by the Supreme Court by reason of massive electoral frauds and a re-election must be held.
Powell Visits Hague in Final Push for EU-US Harmony in His Term
US Secretary of State Powell today held talks with senior officials of the European Union to make one last effort to push forward US-EU unity in his term.
Powell's European tour is aimed at mending the diplomatic impairment between the two sides that has resulted from the Iraqi war. Hague is his last stop.
It will likely be Powell's last official overseas trip in his term. The EU has promised him they will continue working to ease strained bilateral ties ahead of US President Bush's February visit to Europe.
However, differences between the two sides still linger.
"We have to intensify the dialogue and rediscover some common ground during the second term of President Bush," said Dutch Foreign Minister Bot, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.
EU External Relations Commissioner Ms. Waldner says she believes Europe and the United States have already made progress "to put the difficult moments of the Iraq crisis behind us", but she still acknowledges that it is a "key moment in the EU-US relationship" now.
Bush will fly to Brussels on February 22nd to meet with EU and NATO leaders.
Powell says Bush's visit is aimed at mending the fissures caused by the Iraq issue.
Powell has visited Sofia and Brussels during this European trip but has only made limited progress in improving ties.
In Brussels in particular, Powell criticized six anti-war European NATO members for hurting the "credibility and cohesion" of the alliance by refusing to attend the training exercises in Iraq.
However, Powell still firmly holds that his meetings have shown the US's commitment towards fully restoring diplomatic relations.
Basescu Elected Romanian President, Faces Challenge of Forming Government
Romania's opposition candidate Basescu won a fierce presidential election today but the center-right mayor of Bucharest is likely to face big challenges when forming a new government due to the large number of parties in a split parliament.
According to the final official results announced today by Romania's Central Election Commission, Basescu, candidate of the "Justice and Truth Alliance", had won 51.23% of the votes while his rival; Prime Minister Nastase had won 48.77%.
Nastase has conceded the defeat and expressed his congratulations to Basescu.
Outgoing President Iliescu has also congratulated Basescu.
Nastase says his Social Democratic Party will help Basescu to enable Romania's smooth entry into the European Union.
The Social Democratic Party won a victory in the parliamentary election of the 28th last month.
"Today my priority is to form, as soon as possible, a government capable of continuing membership negotiations for Romania to join the European Union. Romania must make efforts to satisfy the demands for the EU entry," Basescu said in a press conference.
He stressed that the Romanian people should know what cost would be paid for the integration. The nation must be united to ensure that there would not be voices suspecting the integration.
Romania has completed negotiations on the EU entry and is expected to join the bloc in January of 2007.
Basescu has also put the fight against poverty and corruption and ensuring legal independence as his priorities.
Dispute over Past Work Remains; Oliver Stone Seeks Peace with Turkey
Movie director Oliver Stone is in Istanbul today promoting the new film "Alexander" and hoping to repair an old rift with Turkey.
His screenplay for the classic "Midnight Express" has been criticized for tarnishing the image of Turkey.
"I never intended it to be against Turkey. It was against injustice everywhere," he told AFP in an exclusive interview.
Public opinion in Turkey has denounced Stone since the first screening of the award-winning film in 1978.
The film was based on the memoirs of Billy Hayes.
Hayes, a young American, was sentenced to 30 years in jail in Turkey after a protracted legal saga that began when he was caught at Istanbul Airport trying to smuggle hashish out of the country.
Critics in Turkey have accused Stone of willfully interpolating Hayes' original book and writing a racist screenplay in which every Turkish character, without exception, is depicted as a villain.
The film is also rife with horrific prison scenes of rape and torture.
Stone has acknowledged that "perhaps some of the zealousness, some of the anger came from being young and trying to make the point too much, too hard".
But he added, "It was true that Hayes did get screwed in the Turkish prison. He was convicted for relatively nothing to 30 years and he was treated brutally in prison. So this is all documented."
"The larger picture is that Turkey is not the only country whose prison system is not working properly. America has similar problems," Stone said.
Japan's Economic Growth Likely to Slow Down Next Year
Japan's economy may be heading towards a slowdown in 2005 as a stronger yen and a growing disparity between rich and poor threaten to spoil the harmonious atmosphere enjoyed in the early part of this year.
While huge corporate profits and stronger consumer spending brought confidence back to Japan this year after a decade of stagnation, analysts now pin their hopes on a booming China to sustain economic growth despite growing political tensions between Japan and China.
The evidence is mounting that Japan's economy could slump briefly in early 2005, especially if industrial production continues to decline as manufacturers adjust stock inventories to avoid a glut.
Under a recently adopted new data methodology, Japan's economy actually contracted slightly in the April-June quarter and grew only 0.1% in the July-September quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession.
At present, economists still differ in their views about the robustness of Japan's economic recovery.
According to estimates by BNP Paribas researchers, Japan's economy will record a 2.3% growth in real terms for both the current fiscal year ending in March next year and the fiscal year that follows.
They call 2005 "the year of recovery" on the grounds that the US economy is firmly on a recovery track and Japanese consumer spending is taking up the slack for slower exports.
Another relatively pessimistic view is from UFJ Institute economists who expect only 1.8% growth in the current fiscal year and an even slower 0.6% for the following fiscal year.
They have cited the "potential risk" that corporate profits have failed to lead to higher personal incomes.
French Foreign Minister: Middle East Peace Process to Test French-US Ties
After a meeting with US Secretary of State Powell today, French Foreign Minister Barnier said that resuming Middle East peace talks would be a "test" of their trans-Atlantic relationship.
Following the death of Palestinian leader Arafat, France called for the rapid convening of an international conference to push forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace process but there was no sign of agreement between Barnier and Powell after their meeting.
Barnier flew into Washington from Paris for a lightning round of talks with Powell and his designated successor, National Security Adviser Rice, before turning around and heading to Brussels for a European Union summit.
Both Paris and Washington have agreed to repair relations strained by the US invasion of Iraq last year, but differences remain clear over how to best resolve the Middle East impasse.
"We want to improve future relations between France and America and Europe and America," said Barnier, after a short meeting with US Secretary of State Powell.
"I think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to launch the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis," he said.
Barnier called early this week for an early international conference on the Middle East to take advantage of what he termed a "window of opportunity" created after Arafat's death last month.
But Powell has not made any promise.
He said the two had spoken of a British plan to hold a meeting bringing in the Palestinians but did not mention if a broader international meeting would be held.
US officials say they have made it their priority to promote the Israeli-Palestinian peace to ensure smooth Palestinian elections next month.
The election will produce a leader who could rein in Islamic militants and resume talks with Israel.
Foreign Minister Machimura Proposes Japan-South Korea Talks for Next January
Japan's Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura proposed today that Japan and South Korea hold talks on a free trade agreement (FTA) as early as January next year.
Jiji Press reports that during a meeting with the South Korean Foreign and Commercial Minister, Ban Ki-Moon, in the southern Japanese city of Ibusuki in Kagoshima county, Machimura said the two sides should resume talks as soon as possible, since both Tokyo and Seoul wish to conclude the FTA by the end of 2005.
The talks between Machimura and Ban Ki-Moon followed the summit of the 17th between Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun, who urged Tokyo to be cautious over imposing economic sanctions against North Korea.
Prime Minister Koizumi is under great public pressure to punish North Korea over its abductions of many Japanese nationals during the Cold War.
The families of kidnapping victims were outraged after Japanese researchers concluded last week that Pyongyang presented the remains of other people in a bid to prove that two kidnapped victims were dead.
Apart from the abduction issue, Koizumi and Roh Moo-Hyun mutually agreed that the six-nation talks aimed at halting North Korea's nuclear weapons development should resume as soon as possible.
Since a standoff starting in October 2002 resulted from North Korea's secret development of a nuclear weapons project, three rounds of six-party talks have taken place and ended without concrete results.
North Korea has boycotted the fourth round of six-party talks scheduled for September this year.
Members of the six-party talks include South Korea, North Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia.
Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Still Expected to Win Next February's Election
Thai Prime Minister Thaksin is confident he will win a second four-year term heading into 2005 but his reputation has been tarnished by a failure to quell a deadly separatist insurgency.
With national elections slated for February 6 next year, Thaksin and his political adversaries are gearing up for a battle which most analysts expect him to win despite the serious violence and bird flu epidemic in the south this year.
A total of 12 people died this year from bird flu in Thailand. The bird flu swept across much of Asia but was particularly devastating in Thailand, where the government admitted it had "made mistakes" in its handling of the epidemic.
However, the health concern is unlikely to unseat Thaksin. Instead, many are asking only how thorough his victory will be, and what will it mean for the Muslim insurgency in the southern provinces.
"The phenomenon here is that no matter how one looks at Thaksin, he has managed to capture popularity for the time being," Kraisak, Chairman of the Senate's Committee on Foreign Affairs told the AFP.
"But things will start to disintegrate next year, if you look at the accumulation of wealth (by his family and associates), the social injustices and the violence," he said.
It is because of social injustices and violence that chaos erupted in Thailand's Muslim-majority deep south, where a sporadic separatist insurgency occurred continuously starting in January.
Since January this year, radical Muslims have targeted Buddhists, government officials and security forces in shootings. They also carried out bombing attacks and beheadings. More than 560 people have been killed and another 100 are reported missing so far.
Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Claims Arafat Poisoned About One Year Ago
Late Palestinian leader Arafat's Cabinet Secretary Abdelrahman reveals that Arafat may have been poisoned one year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in his Ramallah headquarters.
"Something strange happened to Arafat around a year ago. It was on September 25, 2003," Abdelrahman told Al-Hayat newspaper.
"The president shook hands with around 30 supporters before leaving to vomit.
It was from that moment that the president's health started slowly deteriorating."
Arafat died in a French hospital of an unknown illness on November 11.
Some senior Palestinian officials have suggested the veteran leader had been poisoned.
However, French doctors have insisted there was no medical basis for such allegations.
Two weeks before the delegation's call on Arafat mentioned by Abdelrahman, the Israeli Prime Minister Sharon's cabinet had just taken a decision to remove Arafat, although without specifying by what means.
The Israeli threat had prompted expressions of support for Arafat, who thereafter received the visit of several delegations of supporters.
"Arafat shook hands with people, who had come to express solidarity with him in his confinement by Israel," Abdelrahman recalled.
On September 25th last year, Arafat received two delegations, one group of cyclists from around the world on a peace mission and another group of political activists.
"The last time Arafat became ill, on October 12 this year, he had the same symptoms: vomiting, refusal to eat and all the symptoms of a flu," Abdelrahman pointed out.
Bush Recognizes Iraqi Troop Training Needs to Be Improved and Fully Supports Rumsfeld
US President Bush admitted today that the Iraqi army was not ready to replace US troops, and warned that the election scheduled to be held on January 30th next year would not be an end to serious violence in Iraq.
During a one-hour press conference, Bush also expressed his support for Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, firmly believing that the Pentagon chief would "fulfill his duty".
Bush says that despite some occasional serious differences, he has pledged to continue cooperation with Russian President Putin, adding that it is the right time to move on a road leading to the end of conflict in the Middle East.
He also believes that the best way to deal with the issues of Iraq and North Korea, existing members of the "axis of evil", is through multilateral diplomatic mediation.
Continuous car bombing attacks yesterday shocked the Iraqi Shiite Muslim's two holy cities of Najaf and Kabala, killing 66 people and injuring more than 200 others. Bush has recognized that violence has made the Iraqis pay a price but insists that the election in January will go ahead.
Bush has warned the Americans that the Iraqi election "is only the beginning of the political process". He also warns "we certainly don't expect a smooth process."
Bush has also admitted that the training results of Iraqi security forces are a mixed bag.
"Sometimes, when there is fierce fighting, they (Iraqi troops) will run away," he said.
He says such Iraqi troops can never protect the national security, which is unacceptable.
But he believes that after being trained for a long time by the US army, Iraqi forces will achieve good training results.
White House: Iraqi Rebels' Attempts to Sabotage Election Doomed to Failure
In response to rebels' attack at noon today on a restaurant in a US military base in Iraq's major northern city of Mosul, which has killed 22 and wounded over 60 others, White House spokesman McClellan said that as the Iraqi election is coming nearer, terrorist activities by Iraqi rebels will become more rampant but such "enemies of freedom" will surely be eliminated.
Reports from Iraq say that a large explosion occurred in a military base restaurant during lunchtime causing heavy casualties among the US soldiers.
The Iraqi interim government is scheduled to hold the first election since the overthrow of the Hussein regime on January 30th.
The United States has dispatched nearly 20,000 more troops to ensure the security of the Iraqi election.
The total number of US troops during the election will reach 150,000.
McClellan says the nearer the election is, the more terrorist attacks rebels loyal to Hussein will launch in an attempt to undermine the interim government. They want to turn back to the past but "they will be defeated and they are being defeated".
As for a recent poll that shows about 56% of the American people believing the war in Iraq is "not worth fighting", 57% disapproving of Bush's handling of the Iraq situation and 52% believing Defense Secretary Rumsfeld should resign, McClellan says President Bush has never been one to govern based on polls.
"Polls are snapshots in time, and we are working to continue to build upon the progress being made in Iraq."
Mourners Attend Funeral of Philippine Political Figure Poe
A large number of Filipino fans attended today's funeral for this country's most renowned movie star, Poe. The event was held under tight security amid fears of unrest.
Sixty-five-year-old Poe was a defeated presidential candidate.
Mourners accompanied Poe's coffin as it was pulled through the streets of the capital Manila on a carriage drawn by two white horses.
Many riot police were deployed near Malacanang Palace because of concern that Poe's supporters could erupt into violence.
These people have accused President Arroyo of rigging the presidential election on May 10th.
The army has also raised an alert, as intelligence had pointed out a coup was to have taken place to replace Arroyo with Poe's widow Roces.
However, the funeral and burial went off peacefully. Movie fans chanted Poe's initials FPJ and waved presidential campaign posters used by him.
Poe died on December 14th after suffering a stroke.
Crying women and children showered the coffin with flowers as the hearse's procession wound its way to the cemetery.
Malacanang Palace, close to the route of the procession, was barricaded with huge shipping containers as Justice Secretary Gonzales warned that some parties could use the funeral to stir up trouble.
Gonzales said a "credible intelligence report" indicated that there was a conspiracy by some people to use the funeral march and burial to incite the people to turn against the government.
But army spokesman Colonel Pascual said the coup plot obviously fizzled out after the military deployed troops to guard important areas.
Arroyo went out of Malacanang Palace later to greet the soldiers and police who guarded the premises.
Armitage Warns Syria to Cooperate with US on Iraq and Lebanon Issues
US Deputy Secretary of State Armitage warned Syria today, saying the development of future ties between Damascus and Washington rests on whether Syria is willing to cooperate with the US on the issues of Iraq and Lebanon.
Armitage was again putting more pressure on Syria in an interviewed by Arab reporters.
The State Department made the interview public earlier.
"I certainly hope the ties will be improved but this depends on how Al-Assad's (Syrian president) group will do," Armitage said when asked if he expects continuous tense relations between the US and Syria.
The number two figure of the US State Department pointed out that Damascus should implement Resolution 1559 adopted in September this year by the UN Security Council to stop all interfering actions in the neighboring country of Lebanon as soon as possible.
Armitage said what Syria is doing "doesn't go against the US but rather the whole international community".
Asked if the US will bring the question of Syria's refusal of cooperation into discussion when the UN Security Council discusses next January whether UN peace-keeping forces will remain in Lebanon or not, Armitage replied, "We are most likely to do that."
Talking about the Iraqi issue, Armitage recognized that Damascus has indeed taken some actions in line with the US expectations, such as strengthening joint border patrols with Iraq to cut off rebel's funding.
However, he pointed out that Syria "needs to make greater efforts".
AIT and CCNAA Sign Lease for New AIT Building Site in Neihu Today
The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Coordination Council for North American Affairs (CCNAA) today signed a lease for land in Neihu for construction of AIT's new office building. Director of AIT Taipei Office, Douglas Paal, says that the new building is currently being designed and hopes that construction can be completed at an early date so that AIT can operate in a safe, secure and modern environment.
Douglas Paal and John Chen, Director General of CCNAA, signed a 99-year lease for land in the Taipei Grand Hyatt Hotel at noontime, on which AIT plans to build a new office building.
Signing as witnesses in the ceremony were AIT Taipei Office Deputy Director David J. Keegan and CCNAA Deputy Director General Jacqueline Liu. Foreign Minister Mark Chen was also in attendance.
AIT was established by the Taiwan Relations Act to manage the unofficial relations of the United States with the people of Taiwan. It has offices in Taipei and Kaohsiung.
Douglas Paal said in a speech that it had been at least over ten years since AIT began to work with CCNAA and the Taipei city government to locate a plot of land for a new AIT facility.
He said that the current facility on Hsin Yi Road is a bit old and shabby-looking, and has literally run out of space.
For AIT, the transition from the current facility to the new office building will be a challenge. It will allow AIT to consolidate all of its operations, currently scattered throughout Taipei, into one centralized location and operate in a safe, secure, and modern environment.
He said that he design of the new building is underway and he hopes that the new facility will add beauty to Taiwan and become a source of pride for all of Taipei.
Once the design plan is completed, AIT will invite bids for a construction contract and construction will begin after the contractor has been decided. Construction is expected to begin within the next few years.
AIT spokesman Dana Smith said that the building is estimated to cost a total of around US$160 million to develop, including land rent and architectural design. Many factors must be taken into account on whether it can be completed by 2008. He hopes construction work will start as soon as possible.
Thousands of Worshippers Head to Bethlehem for Christmas Midnight Mass
Thousands of worshippers are gathering in Bethlehem in the West Bank for the Christmas Midnight Mass.
Meanwhile, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO)'s mainstream Fatah movement looks likely to defeat Hamas in yesterday's Palestinian local election.
In violent conflicts, Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen were engaged in a gunfight in Gaza, leaving three Palestinian young men killed.
Israeli settlers blockaded a major road to protest a mortar attack on the settlement area.
PLO leader Abbas had also been allowed to go to the West Bank town of Bethlehem, which is the first time in the past four years Israeli authorities have allowed a senior Palestinian leader to attend Christmas celebrations.
Late PLO leader Arafat was a regular guest at Midnight Mass in Bethlehem after his return to the Palestinian territories in 1994 but he had been unable to attend since being confined to his headquarters in Ramallah by the Israeli army in early December 2001.
The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Sabbah is set to begin his traditional procession shortly after midday today to Bethlehem's Manger Square where thousands of Christians and Muslims have already been gathering.
Sabbah is scheduled to address thousands of pilgrims at a Midnight Mass at the Church of the Nativity.
Before the midday, Manger Square had been full of pilgrims with balloons of Santa Claus. They passed in and out of the Church of the Nativity. A Christmas tree outside of the church has been decorated with various lights and ornaments.
The Israeli authority has specially eased travel restrictions to enable Christians from the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Israel to go to Bethlehem for the Midnight Mass.
Putin Claims Purchase of Major Assets of Yukos to Protect National Interest
Russian President Putin pointed out today that Russia's takeover of the major assets of Russian oil giant Yukos was to protect the national interest. It was also the first move of re-nationalization in the post Soviet era.
Talking about the takeover by the Russian State Oil Company of Yuganskneftegaz Oil and Gas Company, Yukos' subsidiary company, at a year-end press conference in the Kremlin, Putin said, "Russia is using an absolutely legitimate market mechanism to protect the national interest.
I think the move is absolutely normal."
The Russian State Oil Company won the bid of Yuganskneftegaz's Baikal Finance Group in a secret auction before the takeover and became the new owner of Yuganskneftegaz Oil and Gas Company today.
The Russian State Oil Company made a sudden announcement just before last midnight that it had acquired 100% ownership share of the previously little-known Baikal Finance Group.
The acquisition has enabled the Kremlin to take a firm grip on Russia's crucial energy industry.
The Russian authority has been attacking Yukos and Khodorkovsky, its billionaire founder over the past 18 months.
The Russian State Oil Company is merging with the Russian State Gas Company. Altogether with Yuganskneftegaz Oil and Gas Company, the three will control 1/5 of Russia's oil production and all its natural gas production to become the world's largest energy group.
Putin has defended the purchase move by attacking the behind-the-scene privatization process of the 1990s.
The then privatization measures had enabled Russian economy's most valuable assets to fall in hands of a small number of shrewd businessmen such as Khodorkovsky.
Baikal Finance Group previously offered $9.35 billion in a bid to win control of Yuganskneftegaz Oil and Gas Company.
Yushchenko Declares Himself Victor in Ukrainian Presidential Election
With preliminary election results showing opposition leader Yushchenko leading his rival, incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovych, in the presidential revote, and Yushchenko having declared himself victor, supporters of Yushchenko held another gathering at the Independence Square today in the city center of Kiev to celebrate the victory.
"This is a clean political victory," Fifty-year-old Yushchenko told the mass assembled at the square.
"This is an elegant victory. The people have demonstrated their power. The Ukrainian people have bravely risen up to resist what is probably the most unreasonable authority in Eastern European countries. Today, the Ukrainian nation and the Ukrainian people have won," he said.
"For 14 years, we were independent, but we were not free," he said.
"Today Ukraine has entered a new political era," Yushchenko added.
"The era of (outgoing President) Kuchma, (Kuchma's predecessor) Kravchuk, and (incumbent Prime Minister) Yanukovych has become history."
According to the votes counted in over half of the constituencies released by Ukraine's Central Election Commission, opposition leader Yushchenko has taken a 16-point lead over incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovych in the historic presidential election re-voting.
Ukraine's Central Election Commission says that the pro-West Yushchenko has won 56.33% of the votes while the pro-Moscow Yanukovych has won 39.86%.
The results are based on the polling results of 50.96% of polling stations across Ukraine.
There are more than 33,000 polling stations in Ukraine.
An earlier exit poll also shows Yushchenko taking a 15 to 20-point lead over Yanukovych.
Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications to Launch Telecommuting Trial to Reduce Office Life Pressures
Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications today launched an advanced Internet program, hoping that 20% of the Japanese workforce could "telecommute" through the program before 2010 to reduce pressures from office life and resolve the problem of family splits.
An official from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications says there are currently about 4 million Japanese, or 6% of Japan's total workforce of 63.2 million, working outside offices through scientific and technological means.
Starting from January, six officials from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will not need to enter the office for at least one day a week, instead using high-speed Internet service to perform their work duties from their homes, universities or libraries.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will expand the scope of the program based on feedbacks to increase the number of telecommuting employees working at home to 20% of its 2,500-strong workforce.
A ministry official says the program, which enables employees to use chat rooms and teleconferencing, is expected to "improve workplace efficiency".
He says telecommuting can offer employees more time to be with their family members and enable people supporting the family to do more housework.
He says the program can also ease the problems of traffic congestion, including a lessening of exhaust gas and less overcrowding of vehicles during rush hours.
He says the aim of the program is to "encourage the sharing of telecommuting technology with private firms", to raise the ratio of telecommuters to 10% by 2005 and 20% by 2010.
Pentagon Launches Unprecedented Relief Effort for Asian Tsunami Victims
The Pentagon said today that it had launched one of the largest relief operations in its history to help Asian Tsunami victims. The operation consists of two aircraft carrier strike groups, 20 reconnaissance and supply planes and tens of thousands of personnel.
Pentagon spokesman, Navy Major Hicks, said that after the tsunami of the 26th, which has killed over 80,000 people, the US military has been facing the challenge of launching operations in several regions at the same time.
"It is one of Pentagon's largest humanitarian relief operations," he told AFP.
Major General Conway, who is in charge of military operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said they are seeking to evaluate the scale of the disaster and have sent assessment teams to Thailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesia.
The Pentagon says it has dispatched 20 aircrafts to Southeast Asia, including six C-130 cargo aircrafts carrying drinking water and food, five KC-135 refueling aircrafts and nine P3 reconnaissance aircrafts.
The Pentagon has also mobilized the USS Lincoln and USS Richard aircraft carriers and their warships.
Conway says the USS Lincoln strike group and its 12 helicopters and 9,000 personnel have departed Hong Kong for the Gulf of Thailand and will be deployed off Sumatra.
The USS Richard with 25 helicopters, 2,100 Marines and 1,400 crew aboard has left Guam and is expected to arrive in the Bay of Bengal on January 7th next year.
The Pentagon has decided to mobilize another 5 ships in Guam and 2 ships in the Indian Ocean base of Diego Garcia with freshwater-producing capability.
Conway says Thailand's Utapao base in the Gulf of Thailand will serve as a command base for US military relief operations.
Nightclub Fire in Argentine Capital Kills At Least 169 Wounds 375
City officials in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires said today that at least 169 people had been killed and 375 injured in a fire at a Buenos Aires nightclub on the night of the 30th.
The nightclub was packed with some 2,000 teenagers celebrating the end of the academic year when the fire occurred.
The city's Health Secretary Stein pointed out that the casualty toll was provisional.
"This is a disaster. This is a disaster," Argentine Interior Minister Fernandez told reporters outside the smoldering nightclub, saying the death toll was provisional.
Stein pointed out that at least 375 people were injured in the blaze, including 18 police officers.
Stein said the fire broke out before midnight on the 30th at this disco club in the city center, where some 2,000 youngsters were attending a rock concert inside the ballroom.
Buenos Aires Mayor Ibarra said that according to unconfirmed reports, the blaze started when somebody tossed a flare during the concert.
"This is a terrible night," Ibarra told Todo Noticias television.
Bodies were lined up on the street as firefighters attempted to put out the blaze.
A chaotic scene unfolded outside the blazing discotheque early today, as hundreds of police and firefighters mingled with stunned teenagers and their parents searching frantically for their children.
UN: Relief Materials Could Take Weeks to Reach Tsunami Victims in Aceh
The United Nations said today that desperately needed relief supplies would take "weeks" to reach tsunami survivors in isolated areas of Indonesia's Aceh Province.
US Navy helicopters arrived in Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh Province, while more and more field hospitals were being put into operation in the city. An enormous amount of relief supplies have been arriving at the airport in succession.
But the chief of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Indonesia, Elmquist, told reporters that a myriad of coordination and infrastructure problems was making it impossible to quickly deliver aid.
"It's going to take weeks before we send relief materials to all the isolated areas," Elmquist told reporters by telephone from the capital Jakarta after returning from Banda Aceh.
"It's a concern and we are desperately doing what we can to find ways of establishing distribution systems in Banda Aceh," he said
The UN and other relief organizations have warned that people in the devastated region of Indonesia's Sumatra may die within days if they do not have immediate access to clean water, food and medical treatment.
Asked if the delay was effectively a death sentence for some tsunami survivors, Elmquist replied, "I hope not. I hope that people are finding ways to get food and water, but obviously it's not a situation we are happy about."
"It's a very serious situation and we can only hope that it's possible to do something quicker," he said.
Japan Offers US$500m for Relief, Topping World in Funds
Japan today promised US$500 million to countries devastated by the Indian Ocean tsunamis. Japan's contribution by far outpledges all the other countries racing to help victims of one of the world's worst disasters, increasing the money the world has promised for relief and reconstruction to more than US$1.6 billion.
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said in a statement that as Asia's largest economy, Japan would consider more assistance including money and technology.
"Japan will provide assistance to the maximum extent possible in three ways: financial resources, knowledge and expertise, and human resources," he said.
"For the time being, Japan will extend to affected countries and relevant international organizations up to US$500 million of grant money as emergency assistance to cope with the disaster," he said.
Koizumi also said he would take part in a meeting of world leaders on the 6th in the Indonesian capital Jakarta to discuss aid for the tsunami-hit countries.
The US government increased its promised aid nearly ten-fold to US$350 million yesterday after US President Bush was accused of being slow to respond to the massive human disaster.
China, which is seen as increasingly challenging Japan for influence in Asia, has promised US$60.5 million, a major sum for a developing nation.
"Japan will make further contributions by utilizing fire-department helicopters and personnel," Koizumi said.
"Japan will also consider, as early as possible, additional contributions including mobilizing Japan's Self Defense Forces' aircrafts, vessels and personnel."
Japan had earlier pledged US$30 million to the tsunami-hit countries.
A foreign ministry spokesman said that the amount was included in Koizumi's 500 million dollar pledge.
WHO: 50 Aid Groups to Offer Medical Assistance in Indonesia's Aceh Province
The World Health Organization (WHO) said today that 50 aid groups had arrived in Indonesia's Aceh Province to provide medical care for survivors of the tsunami disaster.
The WHO's Indonesian representative, Petersen, said the WHO was trying to coordinate all the groups and had held a meeting with them in the afternoon.
Petersen said coordination was proving difficult because many groups had gone directly into Aceh for relief work.
"We are trying to sort it out, everyone has just come in, but everyone has shown a great willingness to cooperate," Petersen said by telephone from Jakarta.
Petersen reiterated that the WHO's main concern was to prevent the outbreak of diseases such as cholera and dysentery, which have the potential to kill tens of thousands of people.
"We are very worried since we have a very large number of people displaced who don't have sufficient clean water or adequate food supplies," Petersen said.
"So we have a situation that is very ripe for epidemic outbreaks."
However, Petersen stressed that there has been no sign yet of any major problems with the diseases.
Indonesia's Health Ministry says up to 100,000 people in Sumatra may have been killed in the tsunami disaster, with most of the victims in Aceh Province.
As most of the medical facilities have been destroyed in Aceh Province, the Indonesian military and the governments of Singapore and Australia have set up at least 8 field hospitals in the past week. The United Nations Children's Fund has also begun delivering basic medical kits intended to help 200,000 children.
Powell Predicts Shiite Victory in Iraqi Election
US Secretary of State Colin Powell today predicted a Shiite victory in the Iraqi elections but he also assuaged concerns it could bolster Iranian influence inside the country because of the past feud between Iraqi and Iranian Shias.
There are growing indications that Sunni Arabs will either boycott the January 30th election or will be prevented from taking part in it by the Iraqi authority due to a spreading insurgency.
"The new government and the transitional national assembly that will come into place will be majority Shiite," said Powell on NBC's "Meet the Press".
"The majority of the Iraqi population is also Shiite."
Shiite Muslims make up more than 60% of Iraq's population, and are concentrated mostly in the southern and central parts of the country.
Sunni Arabs, who live in central and western provinces, comprise about 20% of all Iraqis.
Former Iraqi Foreign Minister Pachachi, who now heads the Sunni-dominated Iraqi Independent Democrats Party, today called for the vote to be delayed but Powell said the Iraqi election would be held on schedule.
Powell also said he felt it was unlikely Shiite control of Iraq's future government would mean it would be run from Iran.
"My sensing right now is that, even though there may be Iranian influence - and Iranians will try to influence Iraq's political situation, but there is sufficient difference and past serious disagreements and conflicts between Iranian and Iraqi Shias," he said.
International Aid Pours in But Time Not on Tsunami Victims' Side
Foreign rescue troops are airdropping food and setting up clean water supplies in Asia's tsunami-hit areas to help millions of victims left homeless and hungry.
Statistics show the death toll has reached nearly 150,000.
Donations are flooding in from various governments while US President Bush has put his father, George Bush, and his predecessor, Clinton, in charge of efforts to raise private aid.
A US delegation led by Secretary of State Powell arrived in Thailand last night to express US concern and assess the progress of the relief work ahead of a crisis summit on the 6th in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
Powell's delegation includes President Bush's younger brother, Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and US Agency for International Development administrator Natsios.
Powell will head the delegation to inspect the disaster in Thailand, Indonesia and Sri Lanka before attending the summit on the 6th.
Powell said the mission of the visit was to assess the situation "and see what else the US might need to do", but he was carrying no new immediate promise of aid beyond the 350 million dollars already committed.
Since the disaster occurred, there is a voice now to give up the search for thousands of tourists still unaccounted for, many of them foreign tourists.
However, Thai Prime Minister Thaksin has vowed that the hunt will go on in his country.
"We will continue to use our best efforts as foreign experts have told me that they (the missing) may have been buried in mud in mangrove forests. So we will not stop searching," Thaksin told reporters in Phuket Island.
An unprecedented international relief effort is underway.
A fleet of US navy helicopters from the US aircraft carrier Lincoln dropped aid and picked up survivors for a second day in Aceh of Indonesia.
Rear Admiral Crowder, commander of the Lincoln, says that 50,000 pounds of food and water have so far been delivered to the disaster-hit areas and the operation is "going great".
Tsunami Relief Efforts Mask Backstage Political Wrestling
With Asian tsunami relief materials flooding into disaster-hit areas, behind-the-scene activities are also underway with governments wrestling over who should offer and receive the aid and who should play a leading role in the largest relief operation in modern history.
The tragedy, which has killed nearly 150,000 people, has rekindled past flames of war, including the differences between the United States, the United Nations and Europe as well as the struggle for the leading role in Asia.
However, relief experts still hold cautious hopes that given the many countries that have been hit by the tsunami, the tragedy on a global scale may set a precedent for countries that have promised aid to indeed keep their commitments.
"Aid commitments by governments have never been 100% fulfilled in time," said International development Professor Juma of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
Governments have already pledged aid of US$2 billion. Prominent figures in the international political arena including US Secretary of State Powell and UN Secretary General Annan as well as the leaders of Australia, China and Japan will hold a crisis summit with deep political implications on the 6th in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
US President Bush increased US aid nearly ten-fold to US$350 million after being accused of being slow in response and following senior UN relief official Egeland's open criticism of rich countries' "stinginess".
In Asia, the tsunami has resulted in a behind-the-scene wrestle over regional influence. Increasingly confident China has promised to offer aid worth US$60.5 million, a major sum for a developing nation.
Japan, which has been reducing its foreign aid for six consecutive years, has shattered remarks that the country's power is declining with rapid action; promising to provide at least US$500 million, a sum which far outshines other nations.
World Leaders Tour Sri Lanka to Assess Tsunami Damage
Sri Lankan officials say that world leaders including UN Secretary General Annan and US Secretary of State Powell are successively arriving in Sri Lanka to gain a first-hand view of the tsunami damage that killed 30,600 people here last month.
They say Powell has already arrived and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae-Chan is due around noon.
The US embassy said in a statement that Powell is to visit some of the areas worst hit by the December 26 tsunami, including the southern region of Galle where US marines are to be based for relief operations.
The South Korean embassy said in a statement that Lee Hae-Chan would tour the west coast accompanied by the Sri Lankan Prime Minister.
"Together with Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Rajapakse, the Korean Prime Minister will travel along the western coast to have a firsthand view of the destruction of lives, livelihoods and property caused by the tsunami," the statement said.
Lee Hae-Chan will stop over in Hambantota, the worst affected area, to oversee relief operations being carried out by private and non-governmental organizations from South Korea.
UN Secretary General Annan is expected to start a two-day visit in the evening.
"He will be touring along with World Bank president Wolfhensohn to some of the affected regions in the south and the east," said UN spokesman Samarsinghe.
World Health Organization Director General Lee Jong-Wook will also arrive in Colombo today.
German Foreign Minister Fischer is due in Sri Lanka by the weekend.
Sri Lankan officials say many other world leaders are expected to come over the next few weeks.
These leaders include Canadian Prime Minister Martin. Canada announced yesterday that Martin would visit Sri Lanka and Thailand later this month.
Bush: US Set to Boost Peace Efforts after Palestinian Election
US President Bush said today he was "deeply heartened" by a strong turnout in today's Palestinian elections and promised that the US would bolster its peace efforts.
"Palestinians throughout the West Bank and Gaza took a key step toward building a democratic future by electing a new chairman of the self-rule government," President Bush said in a statement.
"Observers of the election have described the election as free and fair."
"This is a historic day for the Palestinian people and for the people of the Middle East," he said.
Exit polls show former Prime Minister Abbas has won the election by a huge margin, winning two-thirds of the votes cast.
He will succeed Arafat as chairman of the Palestinian self-rule government.
"These efforts, including today's presidential elections and the parliamentary elections that will follow in several months, are essential for the establishment of a sovereign, independent, democratic and peaceful Palestinian state, a new state that can ensure the security of Israel," Bush said
He said the US government looked forward to cooperating with the newly elected Palestinian self-rule government chairman and the Palestinian people to advance the cause of Middle East peace.
Peace in the Middle East is consistent with the wishes of the peoples of both Israel and Palestine for peaceful and secure coexistence.
Bush has also urged Israel to help improve the humanitarian and economic situation in the West Bank and Gaza.
He added that Arab states must "jointly take concrete steps with all concerned parties to create a regional environment conducive to peace, offer financial support to the Palestinian people, and refuse to assist or harbor terrorists".
Annan's Plan to Visit Rebel Controlled Regions in Sri Lanka Blocked
UN Secretary General Annan said today he wanted to return to Sri Lanka someday to "see all parts of the country".
Annan ended a two-day tour of tsunami-battered parts of Sri Lanka amid reports the Sri Lankan government had blocked him from visiting rebel-held northern areas.
Asked at a press conference whether the Sri Lankan government had blocked him from traveling to zones held by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), as widely reported in several national newspapers, Annan said, "I'm hoping to come back and see all parts of the country and be of help to accelerate the peace process."
Annan said President Kumaratunga had personally objected to his on-site visit in guerrilla-held territory, fearing the rebels would make political capital out of his visit.
"I raised the question of the peace process and the need to intensify the peace efforts," he said.
"I have also discussed that with President Kumaratunga."
The abandoned visit of Annan to rebel-held regions has resulted in the indignation of residents of the rebel-controlled northern city of Jaffna. Hundreds of people staged a protest outside the UN office in Jaffna.
However, the Sri Lankan government has firmly rejected the media reports, saying they are "misleading."
On the other hand, as the relief work is in its full swing, Sri Lanka's weather forecasting authority has warned that Sri Lanka's costal lines are likely to be hit by a Typhoon currently being formed in coastal waters.
Russian Space Agency Denies Rocket Fuel Causes Sickness among Children
The British weekly science journal Nature reports that highly toxic rocket fuel, spewed out during launches of spacecrafts at Russia's space base in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, is causing serious illness among children living nearby. But the Russian Space Agency has denied the claim today.
The science journal Nature report published today quotes a study as saying that levels of endocrine disease and blood disorders among residents in the polluted areas are twice the regional average.
The study was conducted by a team of Russian scientists led by epidemiologist Zykov.
The Russian Space Agency responded by saying that "no direct influence of space-related activities on the population's health has so far been established".
The study quoted by Nature focused on children in the Altai Republic.
The Altai Republic is located in a mountainous region on the southern fringes of Siberia.
The Altai Republic was chosen as the study's target because of pollution from unburned fuel, notably hydrazine.
Hydrazine is used to power the early stages of some Russian launchers.
Zykov compared the health records of about 1,000 children in two polluted areas between 1998 and 2000 with health records of 3,300 children from a nearby unpolluted control group.
Nature reports Zykov has concluded that children in the currently worst-affected areas are up to twice as likely to need medical attention during this time, and need to be treated twice as long.
White House Says Iraqi Election Will Be Flawed
The White House acknowledged today that Iraqi elections set for January 30th are "not going to be perfect". Meanwhile, two car bombings in Iraq's Mosul today killed at least two Iraqi soldiers.
Asked if he agreed with Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi 's statement that violence would make voting impossible in some areas of Iraq, White House spokesman McClellan said, "We all recognize that the election is not going to be perfect."
"This is the first time Iraqis will be able to freely choose their leaders. It's for a transitional government, and it's one of three elections that will take place this year," he said.
"So we're going to do everything we can to help the Iraqi people and the interim government to ensure as broad a participation as possible in this upcoming election," McClellan said.
A bloody insurgency erupted in Iraq on the 11th, which caused the deaths of at least 25 people with 6 killed in a car bombing attack in former President Hussein's hometown of Tikrit. As a result, Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi acknowledged that some parts of Iraq would not be able to take part in this month's election.
Meanwhile, two more bombing attacks occurred in the Iraq city of Mosul today, killing at least two Iraqi soldiers.
US army Sergeant Schaeffer told AFP that a truck exploded when trying to attack a joint convoy of US and Iraqi military vehicles, killing an unknown number of civilians.
Schaeffer said a second car parked on the other side of the street exploded and killed two Iraqi soldiers.
US Trade Deficit Reaches Record High of US$60 Billion in November
The US Commerce Department announced today that US exports sank 2.3% last November, driving the trade deficit to a record high of US$60.3 billion.
US exports fell to a five-month low of US$95.6 billion while US imports rose 1.3% to a record US$155.8 billion as the orders for imported oil increased over 2 billion dollars, up 1.3%, to a record US$14.2 billion.
The trade gap rose 7.7% from last October's revised US$56 billion and a huge 50.8% from November 2003's US$40 billion.
According to a survey conducted by CBS' MarketWatch, Wall Street economists had expected the trade deficit on goods and services to shrink to around US$53.3 billion.
The US trade deficit is still growing despite a weakening dollar, which has made US goods cheaper at home and abroad.
Today's report from the Commerce Department will put pressure on the dollar and renew calls for Washington to do something about US energy independence and the trade imbalance between the US and China.
The decline of US exports last November was caused by a US$1.4-billion drop in capital goods, including US$325 million in aircraft and aircraft engines.
Exports of industrial materials, mainly energy, fell by US$800 million.
Exports of autos, consumer goods and food also declined.
Japanese Defense Chief: Never Forget Militaristic History, Respect Neighboring Nations' Dignity
The Director General of Japan's Defense Agency, Yoshinori Ono, said today that even with Japan's high profile in the world, it would not forget its militarist history and would keep in mind neighboring Asian countries' "dignity".
Asked about concerns likely to rise upon Japan sending its Self Defense Forces (SDF) to the tsunami-hit areas of South Asia, Ono said, "When we have contacts with Southeast Asian countries, we should never forget the past."
He told reporters, "We must establish a kind of relationship whereby we can tell our friendly neighbors that we are friendly.
When looking back at the past, we should fully respect other countries' dignity."
Ono specifically talked about this year as marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. "We hope we can be reborn and cooperate with the new era," he said.
Ono has just concluded a tour of several tsunami-hit South Asian countries. He said that when the Indonesian leader told him that the relief operation by Japan's SDF should come to an end no later than the end of March, he felt the "dignity" of an independent nation.
The UN has expressed its concern over the time limit for foreign troops set by the Indonesian government.
Foreign troops have been widely praised for offering aid to the most remote tsunami survivors.
Nearly 1,000 Japanese SDF soldiers are heading to countries that were hit by the tsunami on December 26th. The death toll of the disaster has exceeded 163,000.
This is the largest deployment operation of Japan's SDF since the end of the Second World War.
Japan's constitution imposed by the United States after the war renounces the use of force by the SDF.
Political Interference in NHK Program? War of Words Erupts in Japanese Media
Allegations that the public-owned Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) had been pressured by politicians several years ago to soft-pedal a program on Japan's legacy of sexual enslavement during World War II have pitted liberal Japanese media against their conservative counterparts.
Liberal Japanese media have attacked NHK for leaving out large portions of interviews it had conducted with mostly critics of Japan's wartime conduct and victims of sex slavery, allegedly after discussions with senior political leaders.
But conservative newspapers have defended NHK's editing of the program, saying that NHK executives have a duty to ensure the fairness and objectiveness of their programs.
The controversy erupted last week over a 2001 program that featured a mock trial on sex slavery of comfort women in the Japanese military during the war.
The trial, held by a women's rights group in Tokyo in December 2000, found the late Emperor Hirohito guilty of allowing the slavery of comfort women during Japan's occupation of Asian nations.
Historians say at least 200,000 young women, mostly Korean but also from Taiwan, China, the Philippines and Indonesia, were forced to serve as comfort women in frontline Japanese army brothels during the war.
The program's chief producer Satoru Nagai held a tearful news conference on the 13th noting that just before the program was to be aired senior NHK officials had met with lawmakers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Shinzo Abe and Shoichi Nakagawa, who expressed concerns over the program.
Nagai said top NHK officials then re-edited and shortened the program.
"NHK bowed to political pressure," he said.
Abe and Nakagawa admitted meeting with NHK officials and telling them to be "fair" but strongly denied pressuring the broadcaster.
Eurozone Indicators Show Core Inflation under Control
Economists said today that Eurozone indicators to be released this week would show that core inflation still remains under control.
Meanwhile, Eurozone industrial output and French consumer spending are both expected to decline.
When the European Union's statistics service releases inflation figures on the 20th this month, they are expected to confirm that inflation will rise slightly to 2.3% in December from 2.2% in November.
But the increase is largely a reflection of tobacco tax increases, and core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9%.
Core inflation figures will be released together with the consumer prices figures.
Economists point out that core inflation, which excludes food, energy, tobacco and alcohol prices, has remained at a 1.6-2% range for the past two years.
European Central Bank President Trichet said on the 13th that short-term price pressures have diminished recently.
While inflation will remain above 2% in the coming months, it is likely to fall below this level by the end of the year.
Meanwhile, another economist says a weak number is expected to be released for the Eurozone's November industrial output on the 18th, given recent evidence of weak growth in Germany.
German output declined 1.7% in November and economists polled by AFP's financial news subsidiary AFX News expect Eurozone output to fall 0.4% in November following the 0.5% drop recorded in October.
Schmieding of the Bank of America says a rebound in Eurozone output is likely in December.
Bureaucracy Hits Tsunami Refugees Twice
Three weeks after the strongest tsunami in history, surviving refugees are fighting with bureaucracy and political domination while the world's attention has already been distracted to other places.
With thousands of decaying corpses gradually unearthed from the rubble, the death toll of the December 26th tsunami disaster has exceeded 168,000. Meanwhile, the upcoming Iraqi election and President Bush's inauguration will replace the tsunami disaster to become the world media's headline news.
Indonesia has backtracked on a demand that foreign troops engaged in humanitarian relief operations will withdraw within 3 months.
In Thailand, leaders of Canada, Sweden, Norway and Finland are discussing the reconstruction project and efforts to identify the dead.
However, survivors are facing new difficulties. For instance, the deep-rooted bureaucracy in Indonesia has hindered the delivery of relief materials pouring in from around the world.
"We are like persons who do not exist. We have been hit hard by the disaster, lost everything and are famished," said Busriadi, a fisherman from a little fishing village in Aceh Province's capital, Banda Aceh, on Indonesia's Sumatra Island.
he asked, "Where are the food, clothes and other relief pouring into Aceh as we have seen on television?"
Busriadi, like thousands of other refugees, lost his identity cards and other official documents in the tsunami, making his quest for aid a nightmare.
Despite begging officials for help and daily hurrying back and forth going through formalities, the results have always been the same: no aid.
Zeng Qinghong Reportedly Paid Visit to Zhao Ziyang Before the Latter's Death
The Hong Kong-based China Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy says Vice President Zeng Qinghong paid a visit to Zhao Ziyang, the purged former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), before he died early this morning in a hospital.
The Information Center has cited Zhao Ziyang's family members as saying Zeng Qinghong visited him at 6:00am in a Beijing hospital, about one hour before he died at the age of 85.
Zhao Ziyang served as CPC General Secretary and Premier, but was ousted for opposing the use of military force to suppress the 1989 democratic movement at Tiananmen Square. He has since been under house arrest and regarded as an unpopular figure by the government.
The Information Center has cited Zhao's family members as saying the incumbent Premier Wen Jiabao, who used to work for Zhao Ziyang, had not paid a visit to him when he was seriously ill.
However, before Zhao Ziyang fell into a coma on the 14th, Tian Jiyun, a retired member of the CPC Central Committee and his former assistant, visited him.
The China Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy has been in contact with Zhao's family and for years has been releasing accurate news about Zhao Ziyang at appropriate time.
The Information Center said some 20 retired senior party, government and military officials planned to write an open letter to the CPC, calling for a reappraisal of Zhao Ziyang's contributions and an open memorial service for him.
The Information Center also said that Zhao Ziyang's family will not be allowed to hold or prepare for a funeral, and relevant arrangements will be finally decided by the Party.
Zhao Ziyang's wife, Liang Boqi, is 86 now.
The Information Center said that due to concerns about her health, she had still not been informed about her husband's death as of this evening.
Zhao Ziyang Passes Away, China Urged to Move Toward Democratization
After the former leader of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Zhao Ziyang, died of illness today, world figures have highly praised him while Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the Taiwan government and overseas democratic movement activists have all called on Beijing to carry out Zhao Ziyang's ideas of democratic reform.
Zhao Ziyang was dismissed from office for opposing the military suppression of the 1989 democracy movement at Tiananmen Square. He was put under house arrest and remained so until his death this morning at a Beijing hospital at the age of 85.
Jiji Press reported Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi as saying, while mourning for Zhao Ziyang, that, "I hope they (China) are committed to democratization.¡±
Taiwan has also appealed to China to carry out political and democratic reform after Zhao Ziyang's death.
Chinese overseas democracy movement activists have praised Zhao Ziyang as "one of China's greatest reformers", who sacrificed his political life in order to oppose the bloody suppression of the democracy movement at Tiananmen Square.
"During his suffering under house arrest for 15 years, he publicly advocated the need for political reforms and progress towards a government of law and democracy," said Lian Shengde, once a student movement leader and now President of the New York-based Free China Movement.
"Zhao Ziyang will be fondly remembered as a true democrat and a person of principle."
Some democracy movement activists have requested the Chinese government hold a public funeral for Zhao Ziyang and give fair appraisal to his achievements.
However, they have acknowledged that Zhao Ziyang will not be offered such courteous service, as the Chinese government fears that people who are disgruntled with the Communist rule will make use of this opportunity to make disturbances.
The 1989 student democratic movement was prompted just by the death of reformist Party leader Hu Yaobang.
Xinhua News Agency reported briefly today that Comrade Zhao Ziyang died in Beijing due to illness, which was the only official announcement on the matter.
UN: Rich Countries Fail to Fulfill Commitment to Reduce Poor Population
A UN appointed expert panel says in a new report that rich countries have so far failed to fulfill their commitments when they promised to offer aid to reduce half of the world's extremely poor population by 2015.
The world's rich countries had promised to take part in the ambitious UN "New Millennium Development Goal" program in order to improve the fate of the world's poor and suffering.
However, over 1 billion people in the world live on less than one US dollar and some 2.7 billion people live on less than two US dollars every day. UN experts say there is almost no time left for rich countries to fulfill their commitments.
"With the right mobilization of resources and political will, and reform in developing as well as in developed countries, these goals are still achievable," said Brown, head of the UN Development Program.
UN experts say the world's 22 rich nations have promised to offer 0.7% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to aid developing countries but they are now providing only 0.25%.
UN Secretary General Annan has commissioned former Harvard economist Sachs to lead a team of development experts to prepare this report on the progress of the goals, which includes extreme poverty elimination, achieving universal elementary education, child mortality reduction and the fight against AIDS and other deadly diseases.
"In fact, the ways to practically resolve the problems already exist, the political structures have been set up and the costs are affordable for the first time. What is needed now is action," the report says.
UN Announces Establishment of Global Disaster Warning System
The United Nations has announced it will set up a global disaster warning system to predict large natural disasters.
However, differences remain over which country's technology will be used in the disaster warning system in the wake of the South Asian tsunami tragedy.
Several UN agencies said in a joint statement after a global conference in Kobe, Japan, that UN experts would create a global disaster system to reduce the damage resulting from large natural disasters.
The large disaster caused by the South Asian tsunami has outraged Indian Ocean nations.
"The new program will bring peace and security to mankind," said Briceno, Director of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.
"An effective early warning system can protect the lives and safety of millions of people around the world."
But the UN statement is largely symbolic.
Officials of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) say more important discussions will be held on the disaster warning system.
The UNESCO is leading the effort to set up a global disaster warning system.
"Several countries have raised their proposals now so we need to do the work of coordination," said Bernal, head of UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.
Bernal says the Commission will hold two meetings within 60 days, in hopes of picking one of the countries' tsunami warning systems.
One meeting will be held in Paris and the other has yet to be determined.
Bernal hopes that a decision can be finalized in July. The global disaster warning system will be completed and be running by mid-2006, which is also the target date set by the UNESCO.
Beijing HIV Positive Cases Rise by 40% Annually
Xinhua News Agency report of December 1st from Beijing (by staff reporters Zhao Xinpei and Li Xu) - Beijing's Municipal Health Bureau recently released the latest figures on HIV carriers in Beijing. Between 1985 and October 2004, a total of 2,046 HIV carriers were reported, with an average annual increase of 40.6%.
According to national AIDS statistics, Beijing ranks 8th nationwide in the number of HIV positive cases reported.
The 2046 confirmed HIV carriers included 403 Beijing residents, 1,507 migrants, 106 foreign nationals and 30 people with an unclear address.
Analysis shows that most of Beijing residents' AIDS cases are related to intravenous drug use and through sex activities. Migrants' AIDS cases are mainly related to intravenous drug use and through blood adoption and donation while foreigners' cases are mainly related to sex activities.
To prevent the further spread of the AIDS epidemic, disease prevention and control centers in 18 districts and counties of Beijing have, starting in July 2004, established free AIDS consultation offices and antibody screening labs to offer face-to-face consultations, preliminary blood screening and epidemic investigations. Such services will also be gradually offered by all hospitals of grade two or above in the city.
The Municipal Public Health Bureau has selected Ditan and You'an hospitals as two designated hospitals in Beijing to offer free treatment for AIDS patients and be responsible for the clinical services of such free treatment. The Municipal Health and the Municipal Finance Bureaus are responsible for uniformly organizing purchases of the medicines and test kits needed in the treatment.
Beijing's Municipal Education Commission has reviewed and adopted a policy offering free education to children of HIV carriers and AIDS patients as well as an educational policy for students living with HIV/AIDS.
Currently, hospitals of grade two or above and with departments of gynaecology and obstetrics are responsible for offering free AIDS consultations and screening. Ditan and You'an hospitals have been selected to offer anti-virus treatment for pregnant women.
So far, 1,390 condom vending machines have been installed free of charge in some districts. Methadone Treatment has been promoted among intravenous drug users and a clean needle exchange trial program has also been launched.
Shanghai Tops World in Power Generation Equipment Output and Capacity
Xinhua News Agency report of December 1st from Shanghai (by staff reporter Jiang Wei) - Following the test run of a 660-MW power generation unit, Shanghai Steam Turbine Generator Co., Ltd attached to the Shanghai Electric and Power Station Group on the 1st reached its target for an annual production of power generation units with a total capacity of 15,000 MW ahead of schedule. This enables Shanghai to top the world in terms of both the production of power station equipment and production capacity, thus fulfilling the long-cherished wishes of several generations of people working in China's equipment manufacturing sector.
Shanghai Electric and Power Station Group is China's largest power station equipment manufacturing base.
Over the past several years, due to the rapidly rising demand for power generation equipment in China, power generator manufacturers entered a stage of high growth and great development.
Shanghai Electric and Power Station Group has combined its advantageous reserve of turbine generator and power station boiler equipment to win via public bidding the order for manufacturing nine units of heavy-duty gas turbine generators and 3 exhaust heat boilers after contracting for four 1000-MW thermal power generation units.
Meanwhile, the integration of operations has further improved the firm's management, technological development and production efficiency.
Currently, Shanghai Electric and Power Station Group holds a 40% market share in China's power station equipment sector and is continuing to expand its overseas markets in regions such as the Middle East, Southeast Asia and South America.
In this year alone, Shanghai Steam Turbine Company has won contracts for power generator's main engine parts worth 6 billion Yuan.
The President of Shanghai Electric and Power Station Group, Zheng Jianhua said that this summer's "power shortage" had resulted in sharply rising demand for power station equipment and that the power station equipment market had seen increasingly fierce competition.
The group is working towards the three big targets of "developing 1000-MW thermal power generating units and gas turbine-generating units as well as 1000-MW nuclear power generating units" so as to become one of the world's Top 500 at an early date.
(Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) Hong Kong Observatory Offers New Services to World Meteorological Organization's Websites
Xinhua News Agency report of December 2nd from Hong Kong - Starting on the 2nd, the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) will offer two new services to the World Meteorological Organization's websites, the "World Weather Information Service" and the "Severe Weather Information Center".
A spokesman for the observatory says the two services will offer official weather observations of global cloud cover and rainfall to the "World Weather Information Service" website and a 7-day review of tropical cyclone movement to the "Severe Weather Information Center" website.
The two services follow HKO's provision of official observation data on worldwide heavy rain (including heavy snow) which was offered to the "Severe Weather Information Center" website at the beginning of the year.
Sources say the "World Weather Information Service" website has been offering official weather forecasts and monthly average climatological data for major cities around the world.
The new service offers official weather observations around the world for the first time, with maps of global cloud cover and rainfall as its primary service items.
The new web pages will cover a wide range of detailed weather observation data with 8 regular updates each day.
The new product for the "Severe Weather Information Center" website is a review function of tropical cyclone movement routes.
It was so designed originally that the website would not keep such information as a tropical cyclone's previous locations after it had disappeared.
However, it has often been the case that the public still want to obtain the relevant data about the tropical cyclone several days after its landing.
To serve this purpose, the new product saves the tropical cyclone's grades, locations and movement routes for the past 7 days so that the public and the media could still obtain needed data about a tropical cyclone several days after its landing and disappearance.
World's First Bird Flu Virus H5N1 Rapid Diagnostic Kits Successfully Developed in Shantou
Xinhua News Agency report of December 3rd from Shantou (by staff reporters Zhang Yiwen and Lin Junqiang) - Sources from the Shantou University Medical College and the Medical School of the University of Hong Kong's Joint Influenza Research Center say that they have developed the world's first bird flu virus H5N1 rapid diagnostic kits after six months of cooperation with Xiamen University.
The rapid diagnostic kits can detect bird flu infections in a suspect's sample as fast as within one hour.
Professor Guan Yi, Director of the Shantou University Medical College and the Medical School of the University of Hong Kong's Joint Influenza Research Center, says that current data shows that the death rate of the deadly infectious bird flu virus is much higher than that of the SARS virus.
Previous tests used to take three to five days to ascertain infection and sometimes more than a week.
The successfully developed bird flu rapid diagnostic technology employs the methods of ELISA and Gold Agglutination tests to examine such samples as nasal or throat secretions and chicken embryo culture for whole or split viruses and blood serum to confirm any infection with the bird flu virus as quickly as within 1 hour or no more than 2 hours.
The new technique is simple, convenient, and easy to apply on the spot in epidemic-stricken areas. It is 90% accurate and helpful for early discovery, diagnosis, isolation and treatment of the infectious disease to prevent the wide spread of the epidemic and large-scale disaster.
Upon the invitation of the China Disease Prevention and Control Center, Shantou University Medical College and the Medical School of the University of Hong Kong's Joint Influenza Research Center recently held a training course on bird flu diagnostic techniques, including the latest bird flu rapid diagnostic technique, for personnel from the disease prevention and control centers of 20 provinces and cities across the country.
Spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Commission in Hong Kong Expresses Strong Displeasure with Remarks by Hyde, Chairman of the US House International Relations Committee
Xinhua News Agency report of December 3rd from Hong Kong - A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Commission in Hong Kong expressed strong displeasure on the 3rd with recent remarks made by Hyde, Chairman of the International Relations Committee of the US House of Representatives, in Hong Kong.
The spokesman said the speech in Hong Kong on the 2nd by Mr. Hyde, Chairman of the US House of Representatives' International Relations Committee, was a malicious attack on China's development and progress as well as a slander on China's foreign policy evidencing a cold war mentality, with which we are strongly unsatisfied.
The spokesman noted that it is known to all the world that China's development is not only in the fundamental interests of the 1.3 billion Chinese people but also beneficial to the world's prosperity and development.
In the international political arena, China is a responsible country and has been playing an active and constructive role in safeguarding the world's peace and stability.
On the issue of nuclear non-proliferation, China has always strictly abided by relevant international conventions, firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in any form, and insisted on solving such issues through negotiations, talks and the strengthening of international supervision.
The spokesman points out that it is regrettable that Mr. Hyde has turned a blind eye to the facts and made such extremely irresponsible remarks as Sino-US relations are witnessing a healthy and stable development, which completely runs counter to the common grounds on the development of bilateral ties reached recently by heads of states of China and the US, goes against the mainstream voice in US asking to strengthen the cooperative relations with China, and is certainly harmful to the development of Sino-US relations.
China's Largest Seawater Desalination Project to Be Kicked off in Zhoushan
Xinhua News Agency report of December 6th from Hangzhou (by Pan Yifeng and Xu Qun) - China's largest seawater desalination project in the mainland so far, with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons, is to be kicked off in the Putuo District of Zhoushan city in Zhejiang Province.
For residents in Zhoushan long accustomed to water shortages, the seawater surging beside them for hundreds of thousands of years will soon become clean and sweet tap water running into thousands of homes.
According to relevant authorities, a cooperation agreement on a seawater desalination project with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons has recently been signed between the Hangzhou Development Center of Water Treatment Technology under the State Oceanic Administration and the Liuheng Township government of Zhoushan city.
The project costs 50 million Yuan and has a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons of fresh water. It is presently the largest seawater desalination project in the mainland. The first-stage of construction is expected to be completed next year.
Zhoushan is one of Chinese cities suffering from a serious water shortage.
The entire city consists of 1,390 islands. The per capita fresh water is 601 cubic meters, which equals to only 25.4% of the per capita average in Zhejiang Province. The problem of drinking water shortages has long plagued residents of the island city.
Taking Liuheng Township in Putuo District as an example, some 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be transported every day into the town from a neighboring one at a cost of over 10 Yuan per ton.
The technique of seawater desalination by reverse osmosis, developed by the Hangzhou Development Center of Water Treatment Technology under the State Oceanic Administration, is a process of membrane separation through the driving force of pressure, which at present is a focal point for current global seawater desalination research.
According to the persons in charge from the center, both the cost and the energy consumption level of the seawater desalination by reverse osmosis project have been lowered through technological improvement and equipment modifications at home.
The cost of seawater desalination per ton has further been lowered from the original 5 Yuan.
This indicates that the cost of seawater desalination is expected to approach that of tap water and industrial water.
(International) Results of Hungarian Referendum on the 5th Invalidated
Xinhua News Agency report of December 5th from Budapest (by staff reporter Liu Weimin) - A national referendum was held on the 5th in Hungary on issues regarding the privatization of the country's hospitals and public health-care institutions and the granting of dual citizenship to ethnic Hungarians living outside the country.
The results of the referendum were ruled invalid as both voter turnout and the number of "yes" or "no" votes cast failed to meet the percentages as required by law.
With 99.91% of the votes counted on the night of the 5th by Hungary's National Election Office, the results showed that a total of 3,011,000 people had cast their votes, accounting for 37.48% of the total number of voters across the country.
Among them, 1,919,000 said "yes" and 1,033,000 said "no" to the first question, accounting for 23.87% and 12.85% respectively of the total number of voters across the country; 1,518,000 and 1,426,000 voted for and against the second question, accounting for 18.88% and 17.75% respectively of the total number of voters across the country.
Under Hungary's relevant laws, a referendum result is valid only if the number of people taking part in the vote is more than 50% of the total number of voters across the nation or if the number of votes for or against the above questions exceed 25% of the total number of voters across the nation.
Before the vote, the Hungarian government and the ruling party had been calling on voters to vote against the two questions while opposition parties called on voters to support them.
Sources say that voter turnout for this referendum was the lowest ever, counting both referendums and elections.
Following the release of the polling results, Hungarian Prime Minister Gyurcsany made a speech recognizing the failure of the referendum.
He said that the government would take more active steps to draw up policies towards nationalities and carry out health care reform.
The chairman of Hungary's largest opposition party, the Alliance of Young Democrats, Orban, said that although the voters did not reach the required number, the referendum was helpful nevertheless.
He called on the government and the parliament to take into account the referendum results when drawing up relevant laws.

(International) Extraordinary Summit of the Andean Presidential Council Held in Peru
Xinhua News Agency report of December 7th from Cuzco (by staff reporters Liu Guoqiang and Wang Lu) - The Extraordinary Summit of the Andean Presidential Council opened on the 7th in the famous Peruvian tourist city of Cuzco.
Presidents or representatives attending the summit will hold discussions on issues regarding deepening the plan of Andean regional integration and promoting economic and social development.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Peruvian President Toledo said that 35 years have passed since the Andean Community was founded but some major issues such as poverty still remain unsolved.
At present, the poverty rate in the Andean region is as high as 53%, which is posing a major threat to democratic rule in the region.
As a result, member states of the Andean Community should seek effective mechanisms for eliminating poverty, and improve people's participation in state affairs to promote social stability and development.
Toledo pointed out that although many issues need to be resolved in the Andean Community, Latin America integration over the last few years has witnessed much progress. The establishment of the South American Community will be announced here on the 8th at the 3rd South American Leaders' Summit.
He expressed his belief that the establishment of this new regional organization will play a key role in promoting regional political, economic and social development.
Besides Toledo, Bolivian President Mesa also attended the meeting.
Colombian President Uribe, Ecuadorian President Gutierrez and Venezuelan President Chavez did not attend the meeting for various reasons, but they will attend the 3rd South American Leaders' Summit to be held here on the 8th.
The Andean Community was founded in 1969, grouping the 5 states of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Peru. It is a regional organization of economic cooperation among Latin American nations with its headquarters in the Peruvian capital of Lima.
The Presidential Council is the highest decision-making body of the Andean Community and meets annually.
The last meeting was held in the Ecuadorian capital of Quito in July 2003.
Three Gorges Project's Underground Powerhouse to Begin Construction
Xinhua News Agency report of December 8th from Wuhan (by staff reporter Shi Yongfeng) - The principal part of the underground powerhouse of the Three Gorges Project began inviting bids for the first time on December 8th, which preludes the construction of the Three Gorges underground power plant.
The Three Gorges Project design calls for installation of 26 700-MW water turbo generator units with an installation capacity of 18,200 MW. After their full operation, the units will generate an annual average of 84.7 billion kilowatt-hours.
To further tap its power generation potential, the Three Gorges Project has reserved a location for the construction of an underground power station in its preliminary design.
According to the chief from the China Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, the Three Gorges underground power station is located in mountains to the right side of the Three Gorges Dam. Major structures include an intake tower, diversion canal, main plant buildings, tailrace systems, bus shafts, and a 500-KV transformer substation.
Six 700-MW power generation units will be installed in the underground power station.
As a result, the total number of generating units in Three Gorges Project will increase from 26 to 32 and the installed capacity will increase from 18,200 MW to 22,400 MW, dramatically improving the power generation capability of the Three Gorges Project.
Flood prevention is a top priority in the construction of the Three Gorges Project.
According to the operation and control plan of the Three Gorges Reservoir, the water level of the Three Gorges Reservoir will need to be lowered from its normal level of 175 meters to the flood prevention level of 145 meters before the start of flooding season each year.
As a result, the construction of the underground power station will raise the water exploitation index of the Three Gorges Reservoir, reducing abandonment of water, increasing power generation capacity and maximizing the station's non-flood peak adjustment period when abandonment of water is not necessary.
At present, the preparatory projects such as the excavation and construction work of the underground power station's tributary canals, tailrace canals and supporting structures have already begun.
Sources say the underground power station will be fully completed and operational at the end of 2008.
Chinese Navigation Festival to Be Introduced
Xinhua News Agency report of December 8th from Beijing (by reporter Huang Fuhui) - The Chairman of the Association of China Railway Transportation, Yao Mingde, expressed at a press conference here on the 8th his "full confidence" towards the introduction of a Chinese Navigation Festival.
Yao Mingde, who is also the director of the leadership working group preparing commemorative activities marking the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's first voyage to the West, said that the 16 departments of the preparatory panel including the Ministry of Communications have all agreed that July 11th of each year, the date Zheng He started his first voyage to the West, will become China's Navigation Festival and a proposal will be raised the State for introducing it.
Sources say the State Council is responsible for approving the introduction of holidays without time off.
Zheng He is a world famous navigator.
During the 28 years between 1405 and 1433, Zheng He led fleets of more than 200 ships with nearly 30,000 people aboard to make 7 voyages to the Red Sea and Africa via Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, traveling over 300,000 kilometers and visiting more than 30 countries and regions in Asia and Africa in the process.
China is to hold a series of commemorative activities next year to mark the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's voyages to the West.
The badge for the commemorative activities was released on the 8th in Beijing.
The badge's design consists of a westward sailing boat, surging blue-colored and curved tides, and the words "the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's voyage to the West 1405-2005".
The designer is Yao Ying, a fine arts teacher from Xi'an Number One Middle School in Shaanxi Province.
People from all walks of life have been calling for a chance to seize the opportunity of the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's voyage to the West in 2005 to strengthen youth education, introduce the Chinese Navigation Festival, raise people's awareness of navigation and sea knowledge, pass down the spirit of the Chinese people, and deepen patriotic education.
Yao Mingde noted that China has a sea area of over 3 million square kilometers with 90% of China's international trade cargo transported by sea.
China is a world navigation power and it would not be proper to lack a navigation festival when the country has so many other celebrations.
Taiwan Province has designated July 11th as the Navigation Festival.
A dozen countries including the US, Canada and Japan, also have navigation festivals.
(International) Parties in Ivory Coast Reach Consensus on Implementation of Peace Deal
Xinhua News Agency report of December 8th from Abidjan (by staff reporter Liu Shaoping) - The United Nations Operation Mission in the Ivory Coast issued a statement on the night of the 8th, saying that UN Sectary-General Annan welcomed the consensus reached by parties in the country on continuing the implementation of a peace deal and called on them to seize the opportunity to ensure "real progress" in the peace process to prepare for general elections in October 2005.
The statement says that Annan also stressed that parties in the Ivory Coast should reach an agreement on a "specific action plan".
He has also expressed his "high expectations" on resolving the crisis in the Ivory Coast through the continuous and joint efforts of South African President Mbeki and the African Union as well as the Economic Community of West African States and the UN operation mission in the Ivory Coast.
Asked by the African Union, Mbeki paid a 4-day visit to the Ivory Coast from the 2nd to the 6th this month to seek ways to resolve the country's crisis.
Mbeki announced at the end of his visit that parties in the Ivory Coast had reached a consensus on a 4-point proposal.
The proposal includes the completion of relevant legislation required by "the Marcoussis Peace Accord", the commencement of a process to disarm the conflicting military personnel, and the return of all ministers to fulfill their duties, and the restoration of domestic security.
The chairmen of the Ivory Coast's parties and groups in the parliament had decided at a recent meeting that the parliament would review the drafts of constitutional amendments starting from the 10th.
Rebels in the Ivory Coast announced on the 8th that rebel leaders would hold a meeting to evaluate the general peace process and discuss the disarmament issue.
A coup followed by a civil war took place in the Ivory Coast in September 2002.
Last January and this July, the major parties in the Ivory Coast and rebel representatives reached agreements in France and Ghana respectively, agreeing to restore peace and realize national reconciliation.
However, implementation of the deals has witnessed ups and downs, resulting in continuous setbacks in the peace process.
The rebel group that controls the northern part of the country recalled its representatives in the government in mid-October, plunging the peace process into a stalemate once again.
The situation in the Ivory Coast further deteriorated after a serious clash between Ivorian government forces and French troops in the country in early November.

Senior peace commissioner Restrepo of the Colombian government accepted their arms on behalf of the government including rifles, machineguns, grenade launchers and mortars and welcomed their surrender at a ceremony.
This is the fourth massive demobilization of rebels since the Colombian government disbanded 855 members of the AUC in November 2003.
In June this year, the Colombian government and the AUC reached a deal on demobilization after negotiations.
Under the deal, 3,000 rebels of the AUC's 11 blocs will be gradually demobilized and reintegrated into society by the end of this year.
The nearly 20,000-strong AUC was founded in 1997, and was made up of the private armed forces of ranchers, mine owners and drug trafficking groups.
Mediated by the Organization of American States, the group is currently negotiating with the Colombian government and has promised to disband all its members by the end of 2005.
Guangxi Marks 75th Anniversary of the Bai Se Uprising
Xinhua News Agency report of December 11th from Nanning (by staff reporter Wang Mian) - A series of activities were held on December 11th in Bai Se, an old revolutionary base with a population of 3.6 million, to mark the 75th anniversary of the Bai Se Uprising.
On December 11th 1929, Deng Xiaoping and Zhang Yunyi led and launched the renowned Bai Se Uprising and founded the Youjiang Revolutionary Base and the 7th Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.
The Bai Se Uprising was another successful armed revolt independently led by the communist party following the Nanchang Uprising, Qiushou Uprising and Guangzhou Uprising.
On the morning of December 11th, more than 2,000 people with flowers in their hands came to the memorial monument for the Bai Se Uprising to lay wreaths and bow... in commemoration of the martyrs' outstanding achievements.
They later watched a movie named "the Bai Se Uprising" and visited a photo exhibition of "Zhang Yunyi in Guangxi".
"Although regular courses on history, ideology and politics teach a lot about patriotism and collectivism, we feel it a vivid course of patriotism after today's on-the-spot visit," said Huang Qunsheng from Bai Se Middle School.
During the celebrations of Den Xiaoping's 100th anniversary earlier this year, the old revolutionary base of Bai Se had started to perfect the patriotic education base by renovating the compound of the Bai Se Uprising Memorial Hall, building a park of steles with Den Xiaoping's handwritings and renovating Yuedong Guild Hall, the site of headquarters of the former 7th Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.
The secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee in Bai Se city, Liang Chunlu, said that the old revolutionary base of Bai Se had witnessed the magnificent feats of our innumerable revolutionary predecessors who had devoted their lives. Today's residents of Bai Se will continue to carry forward the spirit of the Bai Se Uprising and will develop the city greatly to repay their forefather's efforts.
Experts Propose Introducing News Spokesman System for Minors in China
Xinhua News Agency report of December 13th from Shanghai (by reporter Liu Dan) - "The China Youth Social Education Forum --- 2004 Media and the Development of Minors", which ended on the 13th in Shanghai, has proposed that China should introduce a spokesman system in respect of the status of minors to regularly release news on the current development and existing problems of minors.
A recent poll conducted by the relevant organizations in Shanghai showed that minors spend an average of 1.17, 1.05 and 0.99 hours each day on extracurricular books, TV and the Internet. About half of their after-school time is spent on the media, which, as a brand-new social force, has become a factor that can't be neglected in minors' growth and development.
"Media is a window that connects the youths hearts and the outside world. When the window is opened, fresh air comes in. So do flies and mosquitoes",
Chen Tianqiao, President, Shanghai ShanDa Networking (Group) Co., Ltd. said.
While the media may offer beneficial conditions for the healthy development of minors, due to the needs of market competition and economic benefits as well as a lack of quality with some media people, the viewpoints in published articles may easily mislead minors in their thinking and values. Even worse is the dissemination of violence and pornography in some media.
At present, there are more than 2,000 TV channels and over 1,500 radio frequencies with 1,868 radio programs. The number of domestic Internet users has reached 87 million.
Officials of the forum say that the establishment of a spokesman system for minors will offer authoritative investigation data on the current development and problems of young people and change the current "false voices" of the media to create a healthy and favorable environment of public opinions for minors' development.
(International) Iraqi Foreign Minister Believes Iraqi Election Faces Three Major Problems
Xinhua News Agency report of December 14th from Dubai (The United Arab Emirates) (by staff reporters Xing Xudong and Yan Yi) - The Iraqi interim government's foreign minister Zebari said on the 14th in Dubai that the general election scheduled for January 30th next year would face three major problems, namely a deterioration of the security situation hampering and disturbing the election process; an influence in voter turnout due to worries of terrorist attacks, and how to best ensure the transparency and fairness of the election.
Speaking at the "Arab Strategy Forum" held in Dubai, Zebari said that it was essential for Iraq to hold an election on schedule as the election would not only elect Iraq's new leaders but would also certify the fact that Iraq was a free, democratic and unified country belonging to all the Iraqi people.
He expressed his belief that Iraq's future government will become a legitimate government representing the Iraqis and expressing their will.
Zebari said that the US-led coalition forces were present in Iraq at the invitation by Iraq to provide protection to the country given that the current Iraqi interim government was unable to control the security situation and hunt down terrorists and saboteurs.
There will be a time limit for the existence of the coalition forces. Under UN resolutions, it will end after Iraq completes the political process and a legitimate government comes into being.
Zebari stressed that the new Iraq would maintain its Islamic character and abide by the charters of the Arab League.
The Iraqi people are facing a historical opportunity to rebuild the country on a new basis and Iraq will witness its rejuvenation to become an important part in the Arab world that can contribute to all its people.

The company said here during the day that it is actively seeking a Chinese partner to enable a joint fund company to begin operation in early 2006.
The President of KBC Asset Management Co. Ltd, Duchateau, said that as an important step for entering China's asset management market, the company had already officially opened a representative office in Shanghai following approval by China's securities supervisory and regulatory authorities.
According to its development strategy in the Chinese market, the company will first explore the retail market.
He added that the principal guaranteed funds would be the company's most favorable product among others and would also be a must for the company to become one of the world's top financial organizations.
Belgium's KBC Asset Management Co. Ltd, with 50 years experience in asset management, offers asset management services especially for organizational clients, companies and individual investors and helps them to manage a series of collective investment tools.
The company manages extensive fund products.
By June this year, the total amount of assets of principal guaranteed funds under the company's management had reached US$28 billion.
Over the past 10 years, it has issued more than 550 principal guaranteed funds, which are related to over 350 different product structural compositions.
"We welcome the recent decision by China's relevant supervisory and regulatory authorities to allow commercial banks to set up fund companies controlled by themselves."
"We are actively seeking a local partner to set up a joint fund company," Duchateau said.
Duchateau said that the Chinese market still has ample potentials.
Belgium's KBC Bank NV controls 45% of the shares of KBC Asset Management Co. Ltd, which is headquartered in Brussels.
Seven year ago, KBC Bank NV opened its first branch in Shanghai.

(International) UN Warns of Rise in Global Drug-Related Deaths in 2005
Xinhua New Agency report of December 17th from Vienna (by staff reporter Song Guocheng) - The Executive Director of the UN Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention, Costa, warned in a press statement on the 17th that due to the production increase of Heroin in Afghanistan, the world's black market price of Heroin was expected to stabilize with a concurrent increase in drug purity, which is expected to result in more deaths of drug users.
Costa has issued warnings to health and anti-drug officials in Europe and its neighboring countries, calling on them to pay attention to the latest trends in Afghanistan's drug cultivation and in international drug-related crimes, and calling on them to take appropriate preventive measures.
According to statistics by the Vienna-based UN Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention, Heroin production in Afghanistan dropped by 94% in 2001 when opium plantation was forbidden in the country. In the following year, Heroin's degree of purity in Europe's black market decreased by 50%.
Between 2000 and 2002, drug-related deaths in Europe dropped by 20%.
Costa says that compared with 2003, the plantation area of opium in Afghanistan has increased by 64% this year with Heroin's production reaching up to 500 tons; higher than the global black market's one-year trade volume. The trend indicates that the degree of drug purity in the world will rise and drug-related deaths will increase accordingly.
Costa says the drug source in Afghanistan is posing a "clear and real threat" to the world's anti-drug efforts. The increase of Heroin supply in the black market means the "death verdict" for drug users.
It is estimated that around 100,000 people die in the world each year from drug overuse.
(International) US Army Confirms Another Guantanamo Detainee Not An Enemy Combatant
Xinhua News Agency report of December 20th from Washington (by staff reporters Pan Yunzhao and Tan Xinmu) - The US Defense Department's Navy Secretary Gordon England said at a Pentagon press conference on the 20th that a military panel had confirmed that a prisoner detained at the US naval base in Guantanamo was not an enemy combatant and would soon be released.
This is the second Guantanamo detainee to be determined a non-enemy combatant by the US military.
England said the Pentagon confirmed the detainee's identity one or two days ago and the State Department would inform the detainee's home country and arrange the release.
However, he did not disclose the detainee's name and nationality nor under what circumstances the man was captured.
England has refused to admit to mistakes made by the Defense Department in determining Guantanamo detainees' identities.
He said the military panel responsible for identifying Guantanamo detainees had examined 507 prisoners and confirmed 230 people's identities, among which 228 identities of enemy combatants have been correct.
So far, the US has released about 200 Guantanamo detainees, some of whom have been released after their return home while a small number have remained in detention following their return. However at least 12 people have taken part in anti-US army activities after being freed.
There are around 550 "Al-Qaeda" and Taliban suspects currently in detention in the US Guantanamo naval base. Most of them were captured during the US war in Afghanistan.
The US government has declared these people as enemy combatants, instead of prisoners of war, who as a result are not protected by the "Geneva Convention".
Many countries have criticized the US government's indefinite detention of their citizens while some international organizations have also accused the US government of violating international law.
National Top-Level Node for Domain Names to Settle in Shanghai
Xinhua News Agency report of December 21st from Shanghai (by staff reporters Feng Yizhen and Chen Haiyu) - The China Internet Information Center and Shanghai Information Industry (Group) Company Limited signed a deal on the 21st regarding the establishment of a national top-level node for domain names in Shanghai.
Domain names are the basis of communications on which all Internet sites use for E-Business, E-Government, and other applications. At present, they are widely used as Internet addresses.
People wishing to visit websites or send or receive emails must first enter a domain name.  The information transfer is then realized through the domain name system's analysis service which switches the domain name to an IP address to reach the website's servers.
The domain name system is like a "nerve system" controlling information transfers on the Internet.
According to Mao Wei, Director of the China Internet Information Center which is in charge of China's national top-level domain name system, the number of China's Internet users has exceeded 90 million so far, ranking second in the world while the number of websites has surpassed 650,000.
The analysis volume of domain names goes along with the use of the Internet. The analysis volume of domain names has quickly risen with the speedy development of the Internet.
The number of domain name registrations ending with "dot CN" increases by 10,000 every month, and has reached 430,000 so far.
The national top-level domain name server operated and managed by the China Internet Information Center processes more than 380 million domain name analysis requests each day, with an average of over 4,400 requests per second and more than 8,000 at peak times.
Facing the fast development of the Internet, the China Internet Information Center, the regulatory body in China for registration of domain names, has reevaluated 4 original national top-level nodes for domain names and redeployed its top-level nodes for dot-CN domain names based on such assessment.
In accordance with its Internet development level and the software and hardware conditions of the user units, Shanghai has been selected as the location for installing the national top-level node for domain names.
Sources say there are 45,000 dot-CN domain names in Shanghai so far, with Internet prevalence reaching 26.6% and both it's Internet prevalence and application levels leading the country.
There are 130,000 more dot-CN domain names and 230,000 websites in the Eastern China regions neighboring Shanghai, with an advanced development level.
As a result, Shanghai has been chosen as the first node in the redeployment plan.
China Becomes World's Largest Hard Alloy Producer
Xinhua News Agency report of December 22nd from Nanchang (by staff reporters Yang Yuanyuan and Li Xingwen) - China's hard alloy industry has seen rapid development over the past several years with annual output now exceeding 1/3 of the world's total. In terms of scale and output, China has become the largest hard alloy producer in the world, having a large variety of hard alloy products and the ability to produce most of them.
This was learned on the 22nd by the reporters from the ongoing China Ganzhou Tungsten Industry Development Strategy Seminar.
Hard alloy is called "industrial teeth". Due to its high hardness and durability, it is used for cutting tools, high-tension tools as well as for mining and road-building machinery. The development of the hard alloy industry plays a key role in the development of the whole tungsten industry.
Sources say that China's hard alloy sector started from scratch in the 1950s and has continued its development, winning outstanding achievements in the process.
In the early 1980s, the world's annual hard alloy output was 25,000 tons while China's annual output was around 5,000 tons. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the world's annual hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons while China's output has rapidly reached 15,000 tons, accounting for more than 1/3 of the world's total.
Marked progress has also been made in China's hard alloy exports.
In 1986, China's hard alloy exports were only 100 tons but in 2003, exports reached 2,500 tons. This year exports are expected to exceed 3,000 tons, accounting for 1/3 of the world's hard alloy market trade, a share similar to that of its output. The foreign exchange earned through hard alloy exports has increased to $70 million annually from under $4 million in the past.
ADB Offers Loan to Support Shanxi's Use of Coalbed and Coalmine Methane for Power Generation
Xinhua News Agency report of December 23rd from Beijing (by staff reporter Jiang Guocheng) - Sources from the China representative office of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on the 23rd that the ADB has recently approved a $117.4 million loan to support the construction of a power plant in southern Shanxi Province, which will generate power by utilizing methane produced in coal mining.
The coalbed methane development demonstration project will utilize the latest technologies to boost coalbed and coalmine methane production to fuel a 120-megawatt power plant to be built soon.
According to the project plan, it will offer at least 166 million cubic meters of coalbed methane annually to about 90,000 residential, industrial and commercial consumers after its completion in 2008.
Some 410,000 people in the Jincheng area will benefit.
Shanxi's coal production accounts for around 1/3 of the nation's total.
The total cost of the project is estimated at $237 million, with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation offering a loan of $20 million and China Construction Bank offering a loan of $37.86 million.
The Jincheng municipal government and two of the local mining/industrial groups will provide equity capital totaling $61.24 million.
The US Trade and Development Agency has also provided a $500,000 grant.
Methane captured from surface well while drilling an underground coal mine is called coalbed methane while methane generated from underground coalmining operations is called coalmine methane.
Methane is highly explosive and needs to be drained before mining operations to ensure safe working conditions.
Removal, capture and use of methane will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help ease global warming and climate changes.
Methane is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.
Using methane to replace coal can also increase the use of clean fuel, improve coalmine efficiency, and result in cleaner air.
Hassing, an ADB principal project specialist, says the project is expected to result in some 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gas emission reductions.
(International) Israel Museum's Most Precious Possession is Fake
Xinhua News Agency report of December 24th from Jerusalem - Director of the Israel Museum, James Snyder, said on the 24th that an ivory pomegranate, a most precious possession of the museum, had been recently confirmed as a fake.
The ivory pomegranate was once thought to be the only relic discovered so far of King Solomon time's First Temple.
Snyder said in a statement that the Israeli authority had conducted a careful appraisal of the thumb-sized ivory pomegranate.
Experts have found that it is a cultural relic dating to the Bronze Period, much earlier than the First Temple Period of the Jewish people.
The Hebrew inscription on the pomegranate reads: "Belonging to the Temple of Lord Jehovah, holy to the priests."
However, the inscription has been confirmed to have been carved to it later.
The ivory pomegranate was bought from an anonymous collector by the Israel Museum for $550,000 in the 1980s.
Archaeologist and antique experts believe that it was a treasure inlaid on the top of a scepter by a priest of the First Temple.
Snyder says the ivory pomegranate was identified as authentic by Israeli experts including archaeologist Nahman Avigad before its purchase.
Israel's Haaretz reports that Avigad authenticated the antique carelessly only with a magnifying glass.
The claim has been rejected by Avigad himself.
Over the past several months, Israeli police has uncovered three large-scale cases of antique forgery successively and summoned hundreds of people for interrogation.
Police and the Antiquities Authority unexpectedly found the ivory pomegranate was fake during the investigation.
Police will indict some of the people involved in the case next week.
The Jewish King of Solomon built the First Temple on the Holy Hill in the 10th century BC to enshrine holy items such as the Ark of the Covenant and Noah's Ark, which were later destroyed.
Shenzhen to Enforce the Use of "Reclaimed Water" in Some Office Buildings and Residential Quarters
Xinhua News Agency report of December 26th from Guangzhou - As a major step in building a "water-saving" city, Shenzhen will enforce the use of "reclaimed water" in some large buildings and residential quarters. At present, relevant design specifications and regulations for the "Reclaimed water" are being drafted.
"Reclaimed water" refers to municipal and living wastewater which, after being treated, can reach a certain water standard whereby it can be reused to some extent as undrinkable water.
Its quality is between that of tap water and drainage water.
"Reclaimed water" is generally and extensively used for flushing toilets, gardening and farm irrigation, cleaning roads, car washes, city fountains and supply water for cooling equipment.
An survey by the Shenzhen Water Board shows that more than 70 buildings had "reclaimed water" collection systems in Shenzhen in the mid-1990s. However, due to technology, design and management problems, all the systems were left unused as a result of the excessively high cost of utilizing "reclaimed water".
Only an additional investment of some 300,000 to 400,000 Yuan is needed to install "reclaimed water" processing systems in order to bring these pipelines back to work.
It is estimated that if all the existing 70 "reclaimed water" systems were put into operation, 35,000 tons of tap water would be saved in Shenzhen each day, based on an average 500 tons of "reclaimed water" to be consumed daily by each residential quarter.
Sources say Shenzhen's "reclaimed water" collection work will begin with the renovation of the more than 70 buildings with the original "reclaimed water" systems. It will be further popularized based on the experience from the test-run.
Meanwhile, Shenzhen's water resources authorities will join hands with the urban planning and municipal departments to map out "reclaimed water" design specifications and enforce the use of "reclaimed water" in some large buildings.
The treated "reclaimed water" will first be used in city greenbelt irrigation.
27 Zhejiang Tourists Survive Tsunami
Xinhua News Agency report of December 27th from Hangzhou (by staff reporters Feng Yuanqu, Ling Yan and Hu Zuohua) - A 27-member tourist group from Zhejiang visiting Thailand's Phuket Island has successfully won a deadly race with the tsunami.
On the 24th, 26 Zhejiang tourists and one tour guide headed for Thailand as organized by the Hangzhou China Travel Service.
According to Li Hui, Deputy General Manager of the Hangzhou China Travel Service, the 26 tourists departed Phuket Island with their tour guide on the morning of the 27th bound for PP Island, reaching their destination at 10am.
After the tourists disembarked, the seawater surged but they mistook it for a rising tide and didn't pay any attention.
After finding the seawater surging violently, Cai Weiwei, the tour guide, advised them to rush to the seaside hotel to seek refugee.
When they ran into the hotel lobby, they noticed the hotel entrance had already been flooded with seawater.
The hotel had three floors. Surging tides flooded the second floor and they were forced to stay at the top of the building. Luckily, the seawater stopped surging.
19 of the 26 tourists were from the China United Engineering Corporation.
Sources from the company say stranded staff called the company for help with their mobile phones after the tsunami took place. The company immediately asked for emergency help through the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
Hearing the news, the Chinese embassy in Thailand took emergency measures and sent its staff to the spot for rescue operations. At that time they had lost contact with two people.
The company didn't regain contact until the night of the 26th with the two staff who had been evacuated earlier to Phuket Island with other tourist groups. Another slightly injured staff member was evacuated at first instance from PP Island by a rescue boat from the Thai government and had received medical treatment already.
After the tsunami occurred, local transportation authorities went all out to rescue the injured.
They were safely moved to Phuket Island at noon on the 27th.
Li Hui said the tourist group was now anxiously waiting in Phuket Island for a flight to return China. If the flight could be well arranged "they are expected to return home tomorrow."

CBRC to Strengthen Regulation of Asset Management Companies
Xinhua News Agency report of December 29th from Beijing (by staff reporter Wang Weiping) - A recent working conference of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) regarding strengthening the regulation of non-performing asset disposals has decided that regulatory authorities will solve both "surface and root problems" to effectively strengthen the regulation of asset management companies.
Officials from the CBRC said on the 29th that the CBRC would, in accordance with laws, investigate and deal with malfeasance and violations during the management and disposal of non-performing assets. Cases involving criminal liabilities will be transferred to judicial organs for indictment.
The results of major and typical cases will be made public through being exposed publicly to receive social supervision.
The CBRC will, in the near future, improve and strengthen the regulation mechanisms of asset management companies in four aspects:
The first will be to accelerate the construction process of relevant laws and regulations against asset management companies.
A unified plan is to be mapped out for the construction of relevant laws and regulations against asset management companies so as to solve the existing problem of lack of sufficient laws and regulations.
The CBRC will draft and promulgate as soon as possible the "Guidelines on Due Diligence in Disposal of Non-Performing Assets by Asset Management Companies", "Measures on Information Disclosure by Asset Management Companies" and "Measures on Punishment against Malfeasance and Violations by Asset Management Companies".
The second is to improve the governance mechanism of the asset management companies, so as to solve the problems related to their short-term acts and ethical risks in their business operations via systems, mechanism and management.
The third is to strengthen and improve the regulation of asset management companies.
The relevant regulatory authorities of the asset management companies shall share work and cooperate with each other to effectively implement their regulatory functions so as to combine regulation tasks and to improve supervision efficiency.
The fourth is to continue to do a good job in policy research in order to push forward the improvement of the external environment for asset disposal, including the improvement of the market environment, legal and policy environment as well as the infrastructure construction of non-performing asset trading markets.
(Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) Hong Kong and Macao Residents Enjoy "Green Channel" in Application for Setting up Private Businesses in Shanghai
Xinhua News Agency report of December 30th from Shanghai (by staff reporter Yu Lihong) - Starting from January 1st 2005, Hong Kong and Macao residents applying to set up private businesses in Shanghai will no longer need the approval of the competent authorities in charge of foreign investment. Instead, applicants can download the application form from the Administration for Industry and Commerce website, and all 20 branches of the Administration for Industry and Commerce in the city will set up a "Green Channel" to receive the applications.
Sources from the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce say the application process for Hong Kong and Macao residents to set up private businesses in Shanghai is not complicated. Documents required for submission include the "Application Form for Establishment and Registration of Private Businesses (for Hong Kong and Macao Residents)" signed by the applicant, the applicant's identification card and certification documents, business venue certification and other documents required by the State laws and regulations.
Starting from January 1st 2005, Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce will set up special widows and the "Green Channel" in its 20 branches across the city to offer one-stop service, from application, reception to examination and approval, for Hong Kong and Macao residents applying to set up and register private businesses.
In addition, Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce has also offered a download service for the "Application Form for Hong Kong and Macao Residents to Apply for and Set up Private Businesses in the Mainland" on its official website (www.sgs.gov.cn), from which applicants can directly download the form.
Applicants may also learn about relevant information at any time through on-line consultation.

(International) Auctioned Assets of Yuganskneftegaz Not to Be Included in Gazprom
Xinhua News Agency report of December 30th from Moscow (by Staff Reporter Song Shiyi) - The Director of the Russian Presidential Office and Chairman of the Russian Natural Gas Industrial Corporation (Gazprom), Medvedev, told the press on the 30th that Gazprom would merge the Russian Oil Company (Rosneft) as scheduled in January but Yuganskneftegaz, the largest subsidiary company of the Yukos Oil Company purchased by Rosneft, would not be included in Gazprom's assets.
In another report, when talking about the reason why auctioned assets of Yuganskneftegaz would not be included in the assets of Gazprom, Russian Industry and Energy Minister Khristenko said it was because the nation had already been a majority share-holder of the Russian Oil and Natural Gas Industrial Corporation and the nation didn't want to increase its overwhelming share.
He said Yuganskneftegaz's assets would be split off and transferred to a wholly state-owned company.
On the 19th this month, the Russian Federal Asset Foundation held a public auction to sell 76.79% of the shares of Yuganskneftegaz, Yukos Oil Company's largest subsidiary company. The newly formed Baikal Finance Group won the bid with $9.35 billion.
On the 22nd, the state-owned Rosneft announced it had purchased Baikal Finance Group, which won the bid for Yuganskneftegaz's shares, to become the new shareholder of Yuganskneftegaz.
Analysts say one of the important reasons for Russia's maneuver of the auction of Yuganskneftegaz's assets is to position itself in a leading position in relevant legal disputes.
In September this year, Russian President Putin approved Gazprom's merger of Rosneft.
Gazprom was founded in February 1993 and is the world's largest company in natural gas exploration.
The company holds 65% of Russia's natural gas reserves.
Last year, the company's gas output accounted for 93% of that in Russia and 20% in the world.
(Earthquake and Tsunami) Tsunami Seriously Damages Fishing Industry in India's Tamil Nadu State
Xinhua News Agency report of December 31st from Chennai (India) (by staff reporter Jiang Yaping) - Southeastern India's Tamil Nadu State boasts a well developed fishing industry.
The state has more than 1,000 kilometers of coastline with annual marine product exports reaching 370,000 tons and earning 23 billion Rupee (1 US dollar equals to 43 Rupees) for the local government.
However, the rare tsunami caused by the strong earthquake in the Indian Ocean on the 26th has inflicted unseen heavy losses on the local fishing industry.
According to authoritative sources from the fishing industry in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu State, the unexpected disaster has had a great impact on the state's fishing industry.
Because there were no warnings or precautions before the disaster, all the fishing boats were anchored in the bay.
As a result, more than 7,000 motor vessels and over 30,000 barges in the State have been destroyed to varying degrees, accounting for more than 80% of all boats. In addition, over 30,000 fishing nets have been destroyed.
Officials from the Chennai Fishing Industry Association said on the 31st during interview by Xinhua that even if the fishing boats are repaired, fishermen dare not go out to sea in the next few months as they have seen with their own eyes the sea's rampage and ferocity.
Some have lost their loved ones and some have suffered economic losses. Their psychological fears will remain for a fairly long time.
It is estimated that the State's fishery output in 2005 will decline by 30% as compared with that of 2004.
During the tsunami on the 26th, most of the coastal fishing villages in Tamil Nadu State were affected, becoming the most seriously hit area in India.
By the 30th, the State has recorded a death toll of 6,230, most of them being fishermen.
Sources say some 680,000 people were affected by the tsunami with 85% of them engaged in the fishing industry.
At present, the Indian government is actively carrying out rescue operations in an effort to restore the livelihood of local fishermen and fishing production as soon as possible.

Great support and cooperation from the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, the State General Administration of Sports and the relevant authorities in Beijing are all needed in both the frontline work of venue construction, market development, cultural and publicity activities, sports competitions, technical system construction and game services, and the support services of human resource arrangement, financial and capital operation, legal support and supervision and auditing.
The reshuffled leadership will remarkably improve the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee's ability to coordinate and integrate various resources.
(Sports) Sharapova Quits HK Tennis Exhibitation Game on Fitness Concern
Xinhua News Agency report of January 7th from Hong Kong (by staff reporter Ge Hua) - Following Czech teenager Vaidisova's recent withdrawal from the singles competition due to illness, Sharapova, a major attraction in Hong Kong's Watsons Water Champions Challenge tournament, announced on the 7th that she would also withdraw from the tournament because of illness.
"Last night at about 2am I woke up with an upset stomach, feeling cold and flu-like," Sharapova said, explaining the news of her withdrawal from the game.
"I called the hotel doctor who checked me out.
This morning I was very weak, and had no energy. I realized that I would probably not be able to play today.
The doctor also reminded me that it would be best for me to rest until at least Monday."
Sharapova then expressed her apology to the fans. She said, "I feel very, very sad as I love Hong Kong and I wanted to play well in front of my fans here. Unfortunately I am not well enough to perform. I am sorry."
"Sharapova's withdrawal is a heavy blow to the tournament and the fans, but first of all we wish her good health," the game's chief supervisor Kattan added.
In order to console the "hurt hearts" of the fans, embarrassed organizers of the tournament made a temporary change by introducing a best-of-three-sets doubles match with the stars taking part in turns.
Vaidisova, who earlier withdrew from the tournament due to illness, will come to "help". She will partner Russian teenager Zvonareva to meet the challenges from the super-strong pairs of Sanchez-Vicario/Venus Williams and Sanchez-Vicario/Dementieva in turns.
(International) China's Scientific Expedition Team to Reach Highest Icecap in Antarctica
Xinhua News Agency report of January 8th from Ushuaia Port (Argentina) (by staff reporters Cao Yu and Shen An) - The leader of China's 21st Antarctic expedition team, Zhang Zhanhai, said on the 8th that the Chinese scientific exploration team had overcome many difficulties to arrive at a place 50 kilometers from the highest inland icecap in Antarctica, the Dome A Icecap. The team is expected to reach the top of the dome in two days, which will make China the first country to reach "the world's most inaccessible pole."
Zhang Zhanhai told Xinhua reporters that one of the important purposes of this exploration of the Dome A Icecap is to make preparations for building China's third scientific research station in the future in inland Antarctica, and to set up a weather and environment monitoring system between Zhongshan Station and the Dome A Icecap.
The Antarctic icecap scientific exploration team is made up of 13 people between 26 and 54 years old, with an average age over 40.
Seven members of the team have taken part in previous Antarctic explorations and three have taken part in the explorations of mountain glaciers at home.
Zhang Zhanhai said that the icecap scientific exploration was underway basically according to schedule but they encountered many difficulties in the process.
The biggest challenge was the breakdown of one of the 8 sleds due to a broken axle arising from mechanical problems, which brought a halt to the whole team.
As a result, all team members had to pull back 60 kilometers to its base camp and continued the tour after replacing a new sled.
Another difficulty was the high altitude reactions.
Many team members suffered from high altitude reactions after reaching the height of 3,800 meters, suffering from shortness of breath and heart problems.
Members of the scientific exploration team have overcome various difficulties through their spirit of teamwork and hard struggle.

(International) South Korea Launches Trial of Satellite Digital Multimedia Broadcasting
Xinhua News Agency Report of January 10th from Seoul (by staff reporter Zhang Jinfang) - South Korea launched a successful trial of the satellite Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) on 10th, signaling the start of an era in digital multimedia broadcasting in South Korea.
The so-called satellite DMB refers to satellite multimedia broadcasting services, through which users are able to receive program signals over mobile terminals such as handsets.
On the morning of 10th, TU Media under SK Telecom delivered a total of 9 channels in the satellite multimedia broadcasting, including 3 TV programs of news, music and TV plays and 6 music programs of the latest pop songs, old songs and Jazz.
On the same day, SK Telecom marketed the first batch of 250 handsets that can receive satellite DMB, with which some users received satellite DMB programs on air.
Sources say the South Korean government has listed the satellite DMB as its top scientific development project and has been actively supporting firms to develop satellite DMB technology and related products.
In April 2004, the South Korean parliament approved a newly revised "Broadcasting Law", giving a green light to the satellite DMB.
South Korea's SK Telecom and a Japanese firm set up TU Media at the end of 2003, preparing for the establishment of a satellite DMB station.
Enterprises like Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics have, one by one, successfully developed handsets that can receive satellite DMB.
Relevant authorities of South Korea have decided that the satellite DMB will first offer 4 months of trial broadcasting before the formal commencement of its service in May this year.
(Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) Hong Kong to See Economic Growth of Approximately 6% in 2005
Xinhua News Agency Report of January 11th from Hong Kong (by staff reporter Su Xiao) - The APEC Study Center at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on 11th expressed its optimism about the world's economic environment this year, with an expected economic growth of 6% in Hong Kong and a 4.4% growth in the first quarter of this year on an annual basis.
Speaking at the "Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast" press conference, the Director of the HKU APEC Study Center, Richard Y.C. Wong, said despite an expected rise of the interest rate, Hong Kong's major trading partners' slow economic growth and the economic growth of 3.6% and 8.5% in the US and the Chinese mainland respectively, the global economic environment still holds good prospects for 2005.
He said the center predicted that Hong Kong's economic growth would remain at approximately 6% while the consumer prices would rise 3% at the end of the year.
The reshuffling of the labor market will remain slow and the unemployment rate will drop slightly to approximately 6.3% at the end of the year.
The uncertainty resulting from the fluctuation of global oil prices remains the main uncertain factor in Hong Kong's economy.
The Executive Director of the center, Alan K.F. Siu, said the economic growth momentum is expected to be moderate in the first quarter of the year, with the total local output increasing by 4.4%. The slowdown reflects a weakening in external demand, as Hong Kong's major trading partners are growing slower than expected.
According to the report, Hong Kong's real GDP growth is estimated to be a very robust 8% in 2004, with the average consumer price level declining by only 0.5% and deflation finally contained in the third quarter of last year.
Chow Yei-Ching, Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast said the Hong Kong economy saw a robust growth in 2004, which reflected the sound fundamentals of the local economy. The foreign trade sector was very competitive and was able to capitalize on the strong and fast economic growth last year in the rest of the world and the mainland. The defeat of deflation would enable businesses to enjoy stronger cash flows.

Sampaio said Portugal was full of great enthusiasm and interest in the full participation of the Shanghai World Expo and believed that through the Chinese people's efforts and with their wisdom, the Shanghai World Expo would surely be a success 5 and a half years later.
He stressed that as a fast developing international metropolis, Shanghai is playing an increasingly important role in enhancing the mutual understanding of people around the world and strengthening the world's peace, and the Shanghai World Expo would certainly become one of the important events.
Sampaio expressed his high expectations on the Sino-Portuguese cooperation in the work of the world exposition.
He said the relations between Portugal and China were currently witnessing key stages of development. He hoped that the Shanghai World Expo would serve as a bond to further expand the healthy bilateral ties from the political field to the areas of economy and trade, culture, tourism and education and to push forward the all-round development of the ties between the EU and China.
Sources say the cooperation between Shanghai and Portugal in the work of the world exposition covers such areas as gardening planning, exhibition hall design, after-expo use of exhibition equipment as well as skills and experiences in various aspects related to the hosting of the world exposition such as business planning, project management, operation processes, theme expansion, media, personnel training, security systems and control, and ticket strategy.

(International) Yushchenko Asks Supporters to Leave Kiev City Center
Xinhua News Agency Report of January 14th from Kiev - Media reports here said on the 14th Ukraine's two presidential candidates today waged tit-for-tat actions against each other.
Ex-Prime Minister Yanukovych filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, asking to reverse the election results announced by the Central Election Commission while opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko asked his supporters to dismantle and leave the tents set up in the city center of Kiev for the protest.
Yanukovych's representative, Shufrich, offered the Supreme Court 621 volumes of documents and 233 videotapes as evidence.
He stressed that if the court gave an unjust verdict, supporters of Yanukovych would launch large-scale protests across the country.
Meanwhile, Yushchenko and his assistants discussed issues concerning the establishment of a new government.
He issued a statement on the campaign website, saying he would set up a new government with extensive representation and "invite all political forces inside or outside the parliament that are willing to build the country to join the cabinet".
Analysts have pointed out that Yushchenko's move of asking supporters to leave the city center of Kiev has shown that he has already believed that the Supreme Court will reject Yanukovych's appeal and there will be no obstacle to his election and inauguration.
However, he has not set a definite time limit for the dismantling action.
According to the official result after the second round of re-voting announced by Ukraine's Central Election Commission on the night of 10th, Yushchenko had secured a support rate of 51.99% while Yanukovych gained 44.20% among all valid votes counted.

Two Laptops with Inquiry Data on the Cause of Diana's Death Stolen
AFP on the 6th, London
London's Daily Express noted that two laptops with inquiry data on the 1997 Paris car accident that caused the death of Princess Diana were stolen from the office of a former metropolitan police commissioner.
The report pointed out that the theft triggered speculation that the computers may contain confidential information of the probe led by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Stevens.
However, a Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said that there was no sensitive information or any data linked to the probe in the computers.
Lord Stevens is the head of Northumbria Police in Britain.  His office is located in the vicinity of Newcastle on Tyne.
The report said detectives with Northumbria Police have been investigating two burglaries in the past ten days.
One took place on the weekend of January 28-29 with the computers and cash taken; while the other took place last week with nothing lost.
Northumbria Police also said there was no evidence that the two burglaries were linked to Lord Stevens' work.
Stevens has been investigating speculation that the princess of Wales' death was not directly caused by the car accident.
Burgess, the royal coroner, ordered to continue investigating relevant evidence in 2004.
Princess Diana was killed in a car accident in a Paris tunnel on August 31, 1997, along with her lover Fayed and their chauffeur.
After two years of investigation, French Police believed that the tragedy was caused by the chauffeur, who lost control of the car because he was driving fast under the influence of alcohol and prescription drugs.
Two Warring Sides in Sri Lanka Agreed to Hold Talks in Geneva in Last Ten Days of This Month
AFP on the 7th, Colombo
Norway, a peace process mediator, said that Sri Lanka's warring groups agreed to hold talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on the 22nd of this month, breaking a three-year deadlock in negotiations by the various parties to end decades of bloody ethnic conflicts.
The breakthrough was achieved after Norway's peace envoy Solheim met in London with negotiator Balasingham from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelamin.
The Norwegian embassy here said in a statement, "The parties to the conflict in Sri Lanka, namely, the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have asked the Norwegian government to assist with holding talks in Geneva during the two days of February 22-23."
The two-day talks will focus on how to strengthen a ceasefire agreement that went into effect on February 23, 2002, but has not been fully followed by both parties.
The Norwegian embassy pointed out, "The two parties will discuss how they can improve the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.  This is also the first time in three years that the two parties have a face-to-face negotiation at such a high level."
Solheim said he will lead the Norwegian delegation at the talks.  The four LTTE delegates will be led by Balasingham, and the Sri Lankan government will be represented by its health minister.
He said, "This is a small but important step toward the road to peace.  The negotiation process is expected to be tough."
The last face-to-face negotiation to resolve the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka was held in Japan in March 2003, but the LTTE called off the seventh round of negotiations originally scheduled in Thailand in April 2003.
South and North Korean Delegations March into Stadium Together as Winter Olympics Open in Turin
AFP on the 10th, Turin, Italy
The opening ceremony of the 20th Winter Olympics was held today in Turin.  The delegations from South and North Korea, the two Cold War foes, marched into the stadium together for the entrance formalities.
Bora Lee, a female speed skater from South Korea, and Han Jong-in, a male figure skater from North Korea, serving as the respective flag bearers for the delegations of the two countries, led the South and North Korean delegations into the Winter Olympics stadium.
This was the first time that the South and North Korean Olympic delegations had ever marched in together at the Winter Olympics.
In order to reflect the united spirit of the two sides over the past few years of reconciliation, the South and North Korean delegations marched in together at both the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.
North Korea did not participate in the 19th Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, USA.
In 1948, the Korean peninsula was split into capitalist South Korea and communist North Korea.  The two sides engaged in hostile conflict during the 1950-1953 Korean War.
After leaders of South and North Korea held a peace summit meeting in 2000, bilateral relations started to improve.
Following tradition, the Greek delegation was the first nation to enter the stadium.  Among the 80 nations participating in competitions, South Korea was the 22nd and North Korea the 23rd nation to enter the stadium.
The delegation from host country Italy was the last nation to enter the stadium.  As soon as the Italian delegation entered the stadium, enthusiastic cheering and a round of applause erupted throughout the stadium.
Having Succumbed to Drugs, Fortunately Hoffman Sobered in Time to Start Acting Career
AFP on the 16th, New York
Acknowledged as the most likely recipient of this year's Oscar for best actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman, lead actor in the movie "Capote," disclosed that he had succumbed to drugs and alcohol when he was young and reckless.  Fortunately, he then succeeded in quitting and was able to start his top flight acting career.
In an interview on US CBS news magazine 60 Minutes, Hoffman softly sighed that in such period he would truly do anything to get drugs and alcohol.
At that time he was in his early 20s.  Having just graduated from New York University's drama program, he entered into a dazzling society where each day life was so fast-paced and vertiginous that he eventually got dizzy and lost control.
When he was 22, he checked into a rehab center, where he kicked his alcohol and drug abuse habits.  In his whole life, that was the period of time when he felt most panicked.
At the upcoming Oscar Awards ceremony to be held next month, the movie "Capote," in which Hoffman's role portrays American writer Capote, is acknowledged to be the most likely winner of the best actor award.
Prior to this, his excellent acting skills have long been recognized and affirmed by several awards, including a Golden Globe Award for best actor.
The 38-year-old actor said in the interview that if he had not made up his mind to kick the bad habits before he became famous, he may not have been able to win the Oscar nomination.
He said that he envies very much those flashy 19-year-old performers who all of a sudden become famous and rich.
Panic Strikes as Signs of Bird Flu Grow Widespread in Europe and Nigeria
AFP on the 16th, Brussels
Panic strikes as signs of bird flu virus continue to emerge in Europe.
The European Commission passed an additional measure to set up a "buffer zone" to fully administer the areas in countries where bird flu has been discovered, banning trade and transport of all poultry.
Eight days after discovery of the pathogenic H5N1 virus in the African country of Nigeria, outbreaks continued to spread to more chicken farms, with signs indicating it has crossed the northern border into Niger.
Egyptian officials are investigating a sudden incidence of mass chicken deaths on a chicken farm in the south, fearing that the virus may continue to spread.
With chicken markets in Europe plummeting from the impact of virus incidents, the European Commission reiterated that there is actually no reason to panic.
Kyprianou, the European commissioner for health and food safety, said it is understandable that the public is concerned, but there is no need to overreact.
Following an earlier measure creating three-kilometer protection zones and 10-kilometer surveillance zones around outbreaks of the virus, the European Commission issued an additional new regulation setting up a "buffer zone" in the entire region of Europe where the virus has been discovered.
An EU official, who declined to be named, said that everyone is on high alert as they process from morning till night news of suspected outbreaks from around Europe.
So far in Europe, signs of the H5N1 virus have emerged in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, Ukraine, and the European territory of Russia, among other places, almost all found on wild swans.
Romania discovered its 31st case on the 16th.  New cases were also found in Slovenia, Austria, Greece, and on the island of Ruegen in Germany.
In southern Italy, the bird flu virus was found on two ducks, the first creatures other than wild swans infected with the H5N1 virus in Europe.
EU officials are now most worried about migratory birds which will soon return from Africa.
The Nigerian government is stepping up efforts to prevent the virus on the African continent from spreading to humans.
The Nigerian government announced that poultry in a radius of five kilometers from affected farms, whether threatened by the virus or not, must be destroyed without exception.
The neighboring country of Niger declared a national alert and allocated 4 million US dollars to an emergency program to monitor the border with Nigeria.
The newly established national emergency commission said they have received reports that nearly 400 poultry have died in Magaria, which is on the loosely guarded border between the two countries.
Let's again direct our attention to the Iran nuclear issue.
The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed on the 6th that the Iranian government has written a letter to the IAEA requesting for the removal of all the equipment monitoring Iran's nuclear facilities by the middle of this month.
Due to the IAEA decision to report the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, Iran has announced the termination of all its support and cooperation measures on the nuclear issue and will no longer allow the IAEA to conduct snap inspection of its nuclear facilities.
In response to the current tensions concerning the Iran nuclear issue, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said in Athens, Greece, that the cooperation between Russia and Iran still exists.
This will become the motivation for the resolution to the Iran nuclear issue.
A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that day that Russia's proposal to Iran for establishing a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in Russia still stands.
The two sides may conduct negotiations on this issue next week.
On the same day, Lugar, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said at the UN headquarters in New York that the US does not endorse Israeli attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Some recent news report said that Israeli defense experts said that the Israeli Air Force may deal serious blows to Iran's nuclear facilities if necessary.
According to Xinhua News Agency, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Kislyak said on the 7th that Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran on the nuclear issue so as to help Iran obtain the legal right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
Kislyak said that Russia's proposal for a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with Iran is still valid now.
Russia hopes to have negotiations with Iran on this issue in the near future.
At the end of December last year, Russia submitted a proposal to Iran regarding the establishment of a joint uranium enrichment enterprise by the two countries in Russia.
Both the EU and the US indicated that they can accept this plan for a compromise.
However, Iran hopes that Russia can continue to revise the original plan.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said on the 7th that though the IAEA reported the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, it did not hand over the agency's responsibility for handling the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council.
Therefore, all parties still need to break the deadlock on the Iran nuclear issue within the IAEA framework.
According to the IAEA resolution, IAEA Director General ElBaradei will submit a report on the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council in March.
The Security Council will make a final decision after evaluating this report.
We think this resolution is asking Iran to fulfill the relevant Security Council resolution and its commitments without submitting or referring the issue to the Security Council.
Recently, China has been seeking a peaceful resolution to the Iran nuclear issue through diplomatic channels.
Kong Quan said that on February 1, Zhang Yan, director-general of Arms Control and Disarmament Department of China's Foreign Ministry, and Larijani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council and chief nuclear negotiator, held talks on the Iran nuclear issue in Tehran.
The Chinese side hopes that Iran should pay attention to the key issue of the international community and create conditions for peaceful resolution to the Iran nuclear issue.
Solving the Iran nuclear issue within the IAEA framework not only conforms to the interests of the Chinese side but also, as we believe firmly, conforms to the interests of all parties concerned.
For that purpose, we also call upon all relevant parties in the international community again not to abandon diplomatic efforts for this issue.
Hamas, which is currently forming a new Palestinian autonomous government, officially announced that except for the candidate for prime minister, the name list of the new government's cabinet has been basically finalized.
This led outsiders to have a variety of speculations on the candidate for prime minister.
A senior Hamas official disclosed to the Associated Press on the 8th that Hamas is preparing to nominate al-Khudairi, board chairman ((merchant)) of the Islamic University in Gaza, as prime minister of the new autonomous government, but this nomination has not been officially submitted to Abbas.
Backed by Hamas, 50-year-old al-Khudairi participated in the election of the Palestinian Legislative Council as an independent candidate last month.
Al-Khudairi never mentioned violence or anything against Israel in his public speech.
However, he said that Palestine needs internal reforms.
Currently, a senior Hamas delegation is visiting Cairo and discussing with Egypt on the issue of Hamas forming a new Palestinian government.
Khalid Mashal, one of the delegates, told the news media on the 8th that in spite of the pressure that has kept coming from the international community and some Arab countries, the Palestinian government formed by the leadership of Hamas will not recognize Israel.
At the same time, Mashal also warned Abbas in his speech not to willfully change the structure of the Palestinian leadership without prior consultation with Hamas.
Analysts consider this a response to Abbas's plan to appoint Interior Minister Yusuf as deputy commander of the security forces.
However, regarding the issue of forming a new Palestinian autonomous government, Mashal refused to confirm the news that Hamas is preparing to nominate al-Khudairi, board chairman ((merchant)) of the Islamic University in Gaza, to serve as prime minister of the government.
Mashal said that the candidate for prime minister has not been finalized.
Prior to Mashal's reiteration of refusing to recognize Israel, Marzouk, another Hamas political leader, said in an interview with Egyptian TV that Hamas will absolutely not recognize the legitimate status of Israel, but the new government will continue to keep contact with Israel in various areas, because recognizing Israel or not is a totally different thing from whether to have contact with it.
Apart from the fresh or old hatred of the three Hamas prime minister candidates against Israel, the issue of the territory has also been a tough question concerning Palestinian-Israeli relations.
Israeli Acting Prime Minister Olmert said in an interview with Israel TV Channel 2 on the 7th that Israel must separate from Palestine by setting permanent borders.
This means that Israel will have to withdraw from part of its territories in the West Bank.
However, Olmert stressed that Israel will continue to control major Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Jordan Valley area and maintain the integrity of Jerusalem.
Hello, everyone, welcome to the China News program.
The Chinese consulate general in Karachi confirmed on the 15th that three Chinese engineers and a Pakistani driver were killed in an attack yesterday in the southwestern Pakistani province of Balochistan.
Upon learning the news late last night, Chinese State President Hu Jintao showed deep concern for the safety of Chinese engineering and technical personnel in Pakistan.
He instructed the Foreign Ministry, the Chinese embassy and consulate in Pakistan to require Pakistan to catch the murderers, ensure the safety of Chinese personnel in Pakistan, and properly handle the aftermath arising from the deaths of the victims.
Hu Jintao also extended deep condolences on the death of the Chinese victims and expressed sincere sympathy to the bereaved families.
In accordance with President Hu Jintao's instruction, Foreign Minster Li Zhaoxing made an urgent call to Pakistani Foreign Minister Kasuri before dawn today.
The Chinese embassy and consulate in Pakistan immediately activated the emergency mechanism, and relevant personnel have already rushed to the scene.
Premier Wen Jiabao also made instructions on ensuring the safety of Chinese personnel, handling properly the aftermath, and requesting Pakistan to catch the murderers.
In addition, according to the latest information from the Chinese consulate general in Karachi, the remains of the three Chinese were transported to Karachi early this morning and will be shipped back to China by charter plane in a few days.
After the attack, the Chinese consulate general in Karachi immediately dispatched a three-person task force to the scene and transported the remains of the three Chinese engineers to be placed in a hospital in Karachi.
In the meantime, more than 10 Chinese personnel working in the same place with these people have been called back to Karachi.  At present they are emotionally stabilized.
The attack took place in a town called Hub in southeast Quetta.
On the afternoon of that day, six Chinese engineers who worked in a local cement factory were riding in a car leaving the construction site for their residence when an unidentified criminal on a motorcycle stopped them.
The criminal used a submachine gun to fire a barrage of shots, and three engineers died unfortunately.
Following the attack, a tribal militant organization called "the Balochistan Liberation Army" claimed responsibility for the incident.
The Pakistani Foreign Ministry issued a statement that night strongly condemning the attack and calling it an act of terrorism.
The three Chinese who died in the attack were Long Hongbao, Wei Jianping, and Zhao Bin, technical staff from the Hefei Cement Research and Design Institute in Anhui owned by the China National Building Material Group Corporation.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said today that Chinese government leaders showed deep concern over the incident of the Chinese engineering and technical personnel attacked in Pakistan and required the Pakistani side to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel in Pakistan and to promptly catch the murderers.
Qin Gang said that Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Zhang Chunxiang has reported the relevant information and made representations to the Pakistani government and military officials.
Pakistan strongly condemned the barbarous and cruel incident and expressed condolences on the death of the Chinese personnel, vowing to catch the murderers and fully cooperate with the Chinese side in dealing with the incident.
The Foreign Ministry is currently coordinating with relevant departments to arrange for the remains of the victims to be shipped back to China as soon as possible.
A task force dealing with the aftermath formed by the CNBM Hefei Cement Research and Design Institute in Anhui, the institution that sent the victims, left Beijing this morning for Pakistan.
Following the incident, China's Ministry of Commerce also formed an emergency task force.
Chen Jian, an assistant to the minister of commerce, said that if safe operation cannot be ensured for the time being, the project of the cement factory will not start.
Only when the safety of working staff is ensured can the construction be continued.
As soon as the ((emergency)) task force was formed, we immediately, er, instructed the frontline personnel to rush to the scene of the incident and make proper investigations of the local situation.
At the same time, we in China verified the identities of the dead within the shortest possible time.
Chen Jian said that the Ministry of Commerce will pay close attention to the settlement of the incident and will actively coordinate with relevant departments to deal with the aftermath.
If safe operation cannot be ensured for the time being, we will ask the Chinese company to stop.
The construction will not be restarted until safe operation is firmly assured.
The project of Attock Line B Cement Factory started in 2004.
The Hefei Cement Research and Design Institute is responsible for providing the complete set of equipment and technical services for the cement factory.  The construction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2006.
The remains of the three Chinese engineers who died in an attack in Pakistan were shipped back to China from Karachi by a Pakistani Air Force charter plane at 7:00 this morning local time.
Let's take a look at a report by our correspondent Tao Ye from Pakistan.
On the early morning of the 17th, the remains of the three Chinese engineers, who were killed near Karachi, Pakistan on the 15th, were shipped from the PAF Base Faisal Karachi back to China.
The atmosphere was solemn at the PAF Base Faisal Karachi at dawn.
Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Zhang Chunxiang, the interior minister of Sindh Province which has jurisdiction over Karachi, the staff of the Chinese embassy and consulate in Pakistan and the staff of the Chinese company led by Chinese Consul General Sun Chunye bid the final farewell to their murdered compatriots.
All people at the scene led by Ambassador Zhang Chunxiang bowed three times to the three coffins.
After that, soldiers from the Pakistani guard of honor slowly carried the three coffins onto the charter plane provided by the Pakistani side.
They walked together with the Chinese and Pakistani personnel around the plane and finally saw off the murdered Chinese compatriots.
At about 7:20 a.m. the charter plane took off from the airport.
The plane will briefly stop over in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad.
Senior Pakistani government officials will board this charter plane and fly directly from Islamabad to Hefei, China this day.
The plane is expected ((expected)) to arrive in Hefei, China tonight Beijing time.
The charter plane carrying the remains of the victims is expected to arrive in Hefei around 10:00 p.m.
Now, let's connect with correspondent Li Guangyu at Luogang Airport in Hefei.
Hello, Li Guangyu.  Please tell us about how things are going in your place.
Hello, host.
We are not very clear at this point as to the specific time when the plane over there will be landing at the airport here.
What we know now is that their plane from Pakistan will land at Urumqi Airport at 5:30 this afternoon before connecting to a flight from Urumqi to Hefei.
I guess it will arrive around 11:00 or 12:00 tonight.
Regarding what specific ceremony there will be when the remains arrive with them tonight,, and who will show up, er, it is still not very clear at this time.
Well, what we know now is that this afternoon the provincial government and, er, the relevant people from the Cement and Design Institute held some, held a coordination meeting, er, that is, to coordinate some activities tonight.
Er, now the work unit, er, the cement institute here, in the past two days, has formed a bereavement counseling team headed by the chairman of the workers' union.  It has been offering some bereavement counseling at homes of the victims' families here.
As for the specific figure of compensation, we do not have any confirmed and specific answer yet.
Er, we learned that among others there is a four hundred thousand yuan insurance policy for, er, accidental casualties.
Er, the families have not directly contacted the insurance company for compensation.  Rather, their work unit is negotiating with the compensation company, er, the insurance company about the compensation on their behalf.
Er, that's all I have learned now.
OK, thanks, Li Guangyu, for your on-site report.
In addition, at noon today, a total of 11 personnel from the Hefei Cement Research and Design Institute who are in Balochistan, Pakistan, including Yuan Fengyu, Xue Jijun, and Yang Wei who survived the February 15 terrorist attack flew back to Hefei.
When the plane carrying the three survivors and 11 other personnel arrived in Hefei, people waiting at the airport heaved a long sigh of relief.
I feel very happy and relieved to be able to come back safely.
Our country is also (()) paying great attention to this incident.
After the incident occurred, it made proper arrangements for them.
Now they will also be escorted home safely.
Anhui provincial officials, along with officials from the China National Building Material Group Corporation, went to the airport to meet the 11 personnel and expressed consolation to them.
We express our sad condolence on the death of our comrades in this unexpected incident in Pakistan.
We express our warm welcome to the other eleven comrades who are able to return to the motherland safely today.
According to the briefing of the relevant parties, the compensation for the three victims and bereavement counseling to their families are now being carried out.
Although the remains of the three Chinese engineers who died in the attack have been shipped back to China, the investigation into the attack in Pakistan is still underway.
Just an hour ago, that is, 20:00 Beijing time, Pakistani police held a meeting with the staff of the Chinese embassy and consulate in Pakistan to brief the Chinese side on the investigation progress of this incident.
Let's now connect with our correspondent Tao Ye in Pakistan.
Hello, Tao Ye.
Ah, hello, (()).
Yes.
At the meeting %pw just now,
(())
at the briefing just now, what information was given with regard to the progress of investigation?
Ah, OK.
Just as you said, an hour ago, the police chief, that person named Jacob, in Balochistan, Pakistan, that is, the place where the incident occurred, came to the Chinese consulate general in %pw Karachi to brief our ambassador in Pakistan and consulate general on the investigation by Pakistani police of the incident during these two days.
In his briefing he summarized the main clues and targets Pakistani police currently have in investigating the murderers.
Er, they believe that this incident should have been committed by outsiders, but there surely was connection with some local residents.
Well, they have now shifted their focus to, er, er, some employees hired by the company the Chinese engineers worked for.
They believe that these people may have provided some clues, provided some information to the murderers, such as when the Chinese engineers were leaving, arriving, and at what places.
In addition, they may have also provided some cover for these murderers.
Well, this is the current focus of police investigation.
According to this police chief, he said that during two days of investigation, they have inquired about more than 50 people.
Right now, the scope of investigation is being narrowed down.
In addition, following the briefing, the police chief and other police officials also went to pay their respects to, er, the three deceased in the mourning hall set up in our consulate general in Karachi.
Er, in addition, well, there is a more interesting thing.  That is, earlier it was persistently said that the Balochistan Liberation Army (()) claimed responsibility for the incident, but this information has so far not been officially confirmed by Pakistan.
Er, when asked about this by our reporter, the police chief replied by saying that this terrorist organization is actually a very loosely structured organization and does not have a full entity.
Well, er, many people claim they are members of this organization.
Well, so, as far as the Pakistani side is concerned, they, er, still focus their investigation on many specific individuals.
They don't take this organization as a really crucial factor.
OK.
OK, Tao Ye.
(())
Eh, we will continue to watch for relevant investigation developments.
Thanks, Tao Ye, for your on-site report.
Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen held a press conference at the Prime Minister's Residence on Tuesday.
He said that the current development of the incident concerning the cartoons of Muhammad, founder of Islam, is being taken advantage of by extremists.
He ((stated)) that Denmark respects all religious beliefs and calls for the same right of everyone.  Er, he also called on Muslims to remain restrained and not to appeal to violence.
At 4:30 p.m. on the 7th, Prime Minister Rasmussen and the foreign minister held a press conference at Denmark's Prime Minister's Residence.
Rasmussen said.
The violent incidents occurring at the embassies of several European countries are no longer something between Muslim countries and Denmark.
It is very important for the Danish government and Danish people to get the broad support of the international community to resolve this tough issue.
We are allied with France.
Some organizations of other European countries and the United States in Muslim countries are cooperating closely.
Just a few minutes ago, US President Bush made a phone call here.
In the phone call, he expressed support for Denmark, standing by Denmark.
Rasmussen said, we also think that we should resolve this issue through dialogue and tolerance, not through violence.
We stress freedom and democracy, and respect the precious value of religious belief.
Today I appeal to people in all Muslim countries to work together to suppress violence and prevent it from spreading.
We need to resolve the issue through dialogue, not through violence.
Today we are facing growing international developments of the incident.
We saw the Danish national flag burnt and the embassy damaged.
We saw Danish people being considered intolerant people and the enemy of Islam.
This is wrong.
Extremists and radicals are taking advantage of the incident of cultural conflict to escalate the situation.
Rasmussen stressed, we, Denmark and Danish people, are not the enemy of Islam and other religions.
For generations, Danish people have been pursuing human rights, democracy, and freedom beyond politics.
We will continue to strive for that.
This is part of Denmark's history and also a fundamental part of Danish society.
Denmark is one of the most tolerant and open countries in the world.
We respect all religious beliefs.
We stop violence.
We believe everyone has equal rights.

Angry with the publication of the cartoons of Muhammad, Iranian extremists attacked the Danish embassy in Tehran again on Tuesday, throwing gas bombs.
In the meantime, a state-owned Iranian newspaper, in retaliation, held a contest on cartoons about the Nazi Holocaust.
The United States denounced the move as taking the opportunity to reinforce Iranian President Ahmadinejad's persistent outrageous anti-Israeli practices.
Some twenty to thirty protesters climbed over the wall and entered the Danish embassy compound in Iran.
In addition, more than three hundred people threw rocks and gas bombs at the building from outside.
The day before, student members of Iran's hard-line militia led hundreds of demonstrators in attacking the Danish and Austrian embassies in Tehran.
The controversial cartoons were first published by the Jutland Post in Denmark in September of last year.
They were successively reprinted in other European countries and three Arab newspapers.
In retaliation, Hamshahri, Iran's best-selling newspaper, recently announced that it would hold a contest on cartoons depicting the slaughter of Jews by the Nazi Germany.
The move was strongly denounced by the United States and other countries.
US State Department spokesman McCormack said that he thinks the move by the best-selling Iranian newspaper Hamshahri was to reinforce Iranian President Ahmadinejad's vicious anti-Israeli remarks.
McCormack reiterated the US support of freedom of speech in all parts of the world, including Iran.
But he thinks Hamshahri's cartoon contest was totally a different thing from the publication of the cartoons of Muhammad by the Danish media.
McCormack said, I don't think that someone will mention Iran's freedom of the press in connection with the freedom of the press in western Europe and the United States.
Ahmadinejad once called the Holocaust a myth and urged to wipe Israel off the map, setting off widespread criticism by the United States and other countries.
McCormack thinks that Hamshahri is funded by the conservative Tehran municipal government.
It was no coincidence that it should hold this cartoon contest.
Since Attorney Gao Zhicheng initiated a coordinated 24-hour hunger strike campaign in ten cities across the country on February 14, protesting CPC persecution, recently another 170 Shanghai petitioners collectively signed on, expressing their willingness to participate in this human rights hunger strike.
In addition, they said they will continue to publicize the signatures and number of people in the second group of participants.
Next, let's take a look at an interview report by this station.
According to our understanding, under the government's intentional manipulation, real estate prices in Shanghai have become among the highest in the world.
Many government units think of all kinds of ways to forcibly tear down citizens' residences in high-priced neighborhoods without giving reasonable compensation.
These ordinary people who have suffered compulsory eviction, thereby losing their homes, have suddenly lost their sources of income.
Children are unable to pay tuition, and cannot attend school.
For many years, most people who appealed to higher authorities have been sent to reform-through-labor camps for long periods of time.
According to statistical data, Shanghai is the region of China with the largest number of people appealing to higher authorities.
Han Zhongming used to own a storefront, yet it was forcibly torn down.  His private residence was also sold by others for profit.
He was put under house arrest by authorities and was even detained because he appealed to higher authorities.
Having jumped from a building and slit his wrists, among other forms of protest, he was only recently released.
Chen Enjuan's storefront was also forcibly torn down by the government.
The government hired goons to drag her family of three out of their home and used bulldozers to raze the house together with the furniture.
She was sent to a reform-through-labor camp for nearly two years because she appealed to higher authorities.
Speaking about this hunger strike in support of the protest, Chen Enjuan said that besides it was for protesting against government iniquity,
Attorney Gao has also given us a lot of help and very unselfishly helped us.
We are safeguarding our rights because we want democracy, ah, because we are thinking of the next generation.
Our older generation has suffered enough.  We also need to make sure that the next generation will not suffer persecution.  That is why we want to participate in that human rights campaign.  We cannot give up.
According to the Center on Housing Rights and Evictions, a Geneva-based human rights organization, China has been listed among countries with the most serious housing rights violations in the world.
This has been an interview report by NTD News correspondent Wang Xin and guest reporter Gu Qing'er.
In response to the new round of human rights hunger strike campaign initiated by Attorney Gao Zhicheng, many democracy activists and ordinary citizens in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Calgary, Canada, and the greater Philadelphia area in the United States continued to voice their support in various forms on February 15.
The following is a comprehensive report by this station's correspodnent.
Based on the 24-hour coordinated hunger strike campaign in ten provinces and cities across China on February 14 initiated by Attorney Gao Zhicheng to protest CPC tyranny, a signature drive has been launched on the streets of Hong Kong.
Legislator Leung Kwok-hung, who supports Attorney Gao Zhicheng's hunger strike campaign, said that CPC authorities recently have made reckless arrests of human rights activists, which is a dangerous signal showing that this government is absolutely not based on popular will.
The same day happened to be the day for Legislator Attorney Ho Chun-yan, who is preparing to establish a human rights observation team, to have his weekly one-day fast.
He said that this week on this day, he would introduce to outsiders how a human rights attorney in China works.
At the same time, he is sure that this kind of human rights campaign will certainly continue.
On February 13, Epoch Times employees and Falun Gong practitioners in greater Calgary, Canada, held a joint press conference in front of the Chinese consulate to voice their support for the human rights hunger strike relay at home and abroad initiated by Attorney Gao Zhicheng.  In addition, they also protested against the atrocities committed by CPC overseas special agents against Falun Gong practitioner Li Yuan in the United States, calling on the Canadian government as well as all righteous individuals at home and abroad to pay attention to and voice their support for China's human rights movement.
This is Warner Village Square in downtown Taipei.
The global hunger strike relay against persecution initiated by the Epoch Times has entered its second day.
People from all walks of life in Taiwan are participating in droves.
Legislator Tien Chiu-chin came to the scene and joined hunger strikers.
Tien Chiu-chin will fast for 24 hours today to express her support.
"People in a peaceful, more democratic, and freer world should all come to express their support for this."
She said.
Five civic organizations, including the Taiwan South Society and Kaohsiung Medical Association, recently issued a statement that Taiwan should fully voice its condemnation against the increasing violence used by the CPC against human rights activists.
Professor Yang Wei-che from the math department of National Taiwan University said:
"This is extremely important.
It will absolutely become a force.
The evil hand and its vicious tyranny will find it very hard to subdue."
More than 40 people from Delaware, Philadelphia, southern New Jersey, and New York who care about China's democracy and freedom attended a press conference on the global human rights hunger strike relay held in front of the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, condemning CPC special agents' armed beating of Dr. Li Yuan, technical supervisor of the Epoch Times, in broad daylight, and voiced their support for the righteous act of Attorney Gao Zhicheng in China.
This day, fourteen Chinese participated in the global human rights 24-hour hunger strike relay.
This has been a comprehensive report by this station's correspondent.
On February 17, the Indian Border Security Force stepped up patrols along the border with Nepal.
Due to concerns that increasing Maoist rebellions over the past few months may spill across the border, three new battalions have been added to the BSF with the responsibility of guarding the 200-kilometer-long Indian-Nepalese border in the district of Darjeeling.
Nepal has the Himalayas in the north.
It borders India on the other three sides with a border that extends for 1,477 kilometers.
Maoist rebels often sneak into Indian border villages and acquire weapons from local gangs and drug dealers.
Sanaya, BSF deputy inspector-general in the Ranidanga area, said that their current 26 battalions will be increased to 36 battalions in order to facilitate patrols of the 100-kilometer-long border between the districts of Darjeeling and West Sikkim.
Sanaya noted that according to reports, India's Kamatapur Liberation Organisation has joined forces with Maoist rebels in the districts of Jhapa and Ilam in eastern Nepal.
The BFS will set up 18 border observation posts to further strengthen border security.
BFS patrols will bring along well-trained police dogs to detect explosives and drugs.
Border officials also began to thoroughly inspect all vehicles and passengers passing through sensitive border checkpoints.
India is worried that these people may form an alliance with extreme leftists in India.
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world.
The Maoist rebellions have destroyed the entire country's economy and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.
On Friday, Japan's cabinet announced the GDP data for the fourth quarter of 2005.
After price adjustments, the October-December quarter had a real increase of 1.4% over the previous quarter, a rate of increase higher than the expected 1.2%.
The main factors were strong domestic demand and growth in exports to major countries such as China and the US, indicating signs of sustained economic recovery.
This is the fourth consecutive quarter that Japan saw economic growth.  Furthermore, from the first quarter to the third quarter of 2005, it was the largest rate of growth.  It was mainly helped by the stability of personal expenditures, capital expenditures, and exports.
In addition, in April Japan's central bank will end the exceptionally lax currency policy of the past five years, which also backed financial market expectations of economic health.
Following slight improvements in unemployment and wages, consumer expenditures from October to December rose 0.8%.
The Nikkei Index rose after the GDP data was released, but dropped 0.74% by the end of the morning session.
The Japanese yen fell after rising temporarily, with the transaction price fluctuating around 118.15 Japanese yen to the US dollar.
A memorial service for Austrian media magnate Kerry Packer was held in Sydney Opera House on Friday, with thousands of attendees including political dignitaries and celebrities from various fields.
Although Kerry Packer, the wealthiest person in Australia and a media tycoon, has passed away, the state memorial service held for him on February 17 brought together celebrities from various fields.
Among others, Hollywood movie star Tom Cruise and his fiancee Katie Holmes, Best Actor Oscar winner Russell Crowe, and renowned golfer Norman all came to attend.
Australian Prime Minister Howard also delivered a speech at the memorial service.
Kerry Packer, this 68-year-old multi-millionaire, passed away in his sleep on December 26, 2005.
He used to control the Australian media and changed the face of international cricket.
A Panamanian cargo ship and a Chinese fishing ship sank one after the other off the coast of Fujian Province.
According to an official from the maritime rescue center of Fujian Province, China, on the evening of February 16, a Panamanian freezer ship suddenly struck a reef and sank into an area of the sea five kilometers from Dongjia Island in Pingtan County.
Rescuers rescued four sailors, but 33 people are still missing.
In addition, according to Chinese media reports, earlier on February 17, a Chinese fishing ship was also believed to have struck a reef and sunk in the same area of the sea.
Of the 27 sailors on the ship, 24 are missing.
Immediately following the IAEA decision to submit the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council for resolution, Iran reiterated that there is no room for it to have any negotiation with the US, one of the sponsors.
Er, an Iranian government spokesperson said on Monday that the policy toward the US has so far been not to discuss and negotiate over the relations with the other party.
He said that the West made a huge mistake to submit the nuclear issue to the Security Council, which shows the Western interference in the development of Iran.
Iran said on Sunday that it will terminate its cooperation with the IAEA.  In addition, it will resume uranium enrichment and ban snap inspection of its nuclear facilities.
Well, Iran's attitude is now quite firm on this issue, while the US takes an even firmer attitude.
Er, US Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has frequently reiterated that the use of force will not be ruled out on this issue.
Well, now rumors said that the US military is indeed carrying out such a plan.
They are researching and developing a super-sized mother of all bombs.
Er, once the Defense Department issues the order, they will use this super-sized bomb to blow up Iran.
Then, how big a bomb is this mother of all bombs?
Its weight alone is said to be more than thirty thousand pounds, which is equivalent to that of a two-story bus.  Er, in addition, it is also very large in size.
Well, the main purpose of developing such a super bomb is to blow up some underground facilities in Iran.
Since it has an extremely powerful penetration, it can penetrate the concrete as well as steel plate, probably causing a large pit of about 60 feet long and half a mile in size.  Er, it will destroy many underground construction and facilities.
Well, it now seems that the United States has really started to sharpen its spear or make bombs at the last minute in this respect.
Rumsfeld said that no method will be ruled out on this issue, the resolution to the Iran nuclear issue.  The method of force has already been put on the agenda.
In addition, the Iran nuclear issue is continuing to escalate.  Well, er, relevant Iranian officials in China said in an interview with this station that actually Iran still insists on cooperating with the international community through peaceful negotiations, er, in hopes of relieving the crisis.
However, they also said that Iran will adjust the content of its nuclear project cooperation with Russia.
With regard to the upcoming second round of talks on the uranium enrichment cooperation project between Iran and Russia on February 16, the Iranian side said that the talks will be carried out as scheduled, but it stressed that the content of talks will be adjusted based on the current developments of the situation.
Earlier Russia always expressed its support for Iran's peaceful use of nuclear energy and said it would not refer the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council.
However, now we see they have agreed to refer the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council.
Under this new situation now, we may make some changes regarding our policy agreed upon with Russia earlier.
Yet, before the UN Security Council makes its final decision in March on whether to adopt economic and political sanctions, Iran maintains that it will continue to negotiate with relevant international institutions.  At the same time it is willing to cooperate with the international community to relieve the current crisis.
We emphasized that Iran will not relinquish its right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in order to attain its own economic and national development.
Iran has not violated any relevant international law, and we hope the United States can also understand that.
The Iran nuclear issue is completely different from the issues of Afghanistan and Iraq.
I think the US itself is well aware of this point.
With regard to the so-called military attacks, we have not seen that the US has declared any explicit position.
We don't want to see the crisis further escalate.
We also emphasize on using the method of peaceful negotiations, but we will not yield to pressure.
In addition ((agebi)) also expressed hope that China will continue to cooperate with Iran on the basis of its original position.

This comprehensive report has been brought to you by Phoenix Satellite TV.
As the blizzard swept across the US northeast region, New York City is naturally one of the cities affected.
Let's now connect with Luo Xiaoying, our New York-based correspondent, to find out about the local situation.
Hello, Xiaoying.
Hello, Xiaonan.
Yes.
With such a heavy snowfall here, how exactly is everything going?
I heard that some places did not even have power supply.
What other places are affected?
Yes, that's right.
In fact, this blizzard covered quite an extensive area, ah.
Well, I am happy to tell you that we have now finally seen that the blizzard has stopped.
In spite of the fierce onset of the blizzard, oh, no serious casualties have been reported.
Within its scope, several states in the eastern US were affected.  For instance, Maryland recorded 21 inches of snow, Pennsylvania, 19 inches, and the areas in New York and New Jersey, over 24 inches.
Flurries of snow can be seen from Virginia to Maine, or even Tennessee.
Well, er, as you mentioned just now, um, many places in the Washington area and Baltimore indeed experienced power shortage.
The %pw total number of households cut from power is probably more than one hundred thousand.
Well, New York City is fine.  The outage, er, power supply in the Manhattan area of New York City is very normal.  Only some places in the Long Island area experienced power outage.
The state of Rhode Island declared a state of emergency.
Well, roads are open only to emergency vehicles such as snow plowers and ambulances.
With regard to traffic and transportation, oh, earlier the three major airports in the, um, New York area were all closed.
However, er, toward evening, we found, for instance, the Newark airport in New Jersey and LaGuardia airport in New York have started to show some signs of resuming airport operations.
So, some people estimated that these airports may be opened in a few hours.
For example, Delta Airlines, eh, Delta Airlines, it announced that flights at places like Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, and Connecticut were all cancelled till Monday, oh.
Now the Reagan airport in the capital of Washington is currently open.
Well, bus services in New York and New Jersey areas are now stopped.
%pw trains are also running on reduced schedules.
Well, right now, we are...er, it is now Sunday in New York.  It is still the Lantern Festival holiday.
To us Chinese people, originally at the Lantern Festival, there were some Lantern Festival activities in some local Chinese communities, but they all had to be cancelled.
Well, for New York people, most of their usual Sunday activities were also cancelled.  Oh, few people went outdoors, that is, everyone stayed at home.
Uh-huh.
What gives people headaches is how they are supposed to go to work on Monday.
In addition, the clear snow, the accumulated snow may cause some flooding.
So, the governments in these affected areas in the US are studying how to deal with the rushing crowds of commuters and cars on their way to work on Monday.
Xiaonan.
All right.
Thank you, Xiaonan, for the latest report from the US.
Since there is no other alternative, we can be relaxed and enjoy this very beautiful snowy scenery.
Let's look at a few Japan-related news items.
Er, Koizumi has always wanted to upgrade Japan's Defense Agency to a ministry, so as to increase Japan's military strength.
However, along the way, this process has aroused a lot of controversy and undergone many twists and turns.
Recently, some project bid-rigging scandals broke out in the Defense Facilities Administration Agency under Japan's Defense Agency, causing some current and former officials to be arrested by authorities.
As a result, quite a few people advised Koizumi to be careful about upgrading the agency to a ministry.
Well, recently Koizumi said that he would shelve this plan and would not submit it to the Diet for review for the time being.
Well, he also hopes the two governing parties can carefully discuss this issue and continue, er, consultations.
On another note, if you go to Japan, there is now a new regulation.
That is, Japan plans, stipulates that most tourists and travelers to Japan must have their fingerprints scanned and photographs taken.
This is a way of preventing some dangerous people from entering Japanese territory, and in addition, of guarding against illegal immigrants.
Er, so, going to Japan should now be even more difficult.
Well, of course, recently there has also been a piece of good news in Japan.
That is, Princess Kiko, wife of Japan's Prince Akishinomiya, is pregnant.
The event makes many Japanese hopeful that she can give birth to a boy to succeed the throne.
However, she also brought some disturbance to the otherwise quite peaceful Imperial Household.
Er, in fact Kiko is now surely quite old for a pregnant woman.  Moreover, people have always thought she was satisfied with a four-member family.
To be pregnant again at such an age, many people cannot help speculating that er, this may be a fight for the throne between brothers of the Imperial Household.
Of course, this conspiracy theory has been a fascinating topic for many people.
It is said that this matter may be traced back to several years ago.
Er, it is like this.  When the wife of Crown Prince Naruhito suffered from depression in 2002, the Imperial Household placed little hope on them and turned to put pressure on Prince Fumihito.
At that time, Fumihito did not respond much to this.
But by 2004, the conflict had become somewhat intense, because Naruhito, eager to protect his wife, criticized the Imperial Household in public.
Well, it is said that the Imperial Household at that time was furious and asked Prince Fumihito, who is of the same generation, to come out and accuse his elder brother of showing no respect to the Imperial Household while spoiling his own wife.
The two brothers have not been on good terms since.
Well, now if a boy is born to Prince Fumihito, then they, as core members, will become a pillar of the Imperial Household.
Meanwhile, the Eastern Palace, that is, the elder prince, would surely decline as a result.
Er, so, quite a number of people think that if this is the case, it will have a great impact on the Imperial Household and Japanese society.
On Monday UN Secretary General Annan went to the White House to meet with US President Bush.
With regard to Iran's announcement of its postponement of nuclear talks with Russia, Annan urged Iran to stop nuclear activities as soon as possible and resolve the issue through negotiations instead of confrontation.
In addition, some sources said that the US Defense Department has actually already started planning for an intensive bombing on Iran as a last resort should diplomatic efforts fail.
Originally, outsiders think that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of the UN Security Council sanctions against Iran, but the two did not publicize any discussion in this regard after their meeting.
Both Bush and Annan reiterated their hope that the Iran nuclear issue should be resolved through negotiations.
Annan expressed his concern that Iran started uranium enrichment and decided to postpone nuclear negotiations with Russia.
On the same day, US media reports said that military tactic experts from the Pentagon have already started planning for an intensive military action so that the US will prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons by military means should diplomatic efforts fail.
According to the reports, the commander of the US Central Command is making decisions on the targets of attacks.
There may be a submarine-launched ballistic missile strike or air strikes by B-2 bombers.
On Monday, Annan called upon all parties involved not to take any action that may escalate the crisis.
Some military experts analyzed that Iran may acquire the ability to produce nuclear weapons within two years.
And there are more than two years left from Bush's second term.
He will try to resolve the Iran nuclear issue during his term whether by peaceful or military means.
Mo Naiqian reporting from Washington for Phoenix Satellite TV.
Iranian President Ahmadinejad said on the 13th that superpowers that threaten other countries with their own weapons will soon disappear.
At the 27th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution, Ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys of various countries in Tehran.
He said that arms race and competition for hegemony among various countries in the world will achieve nothing.
The greed of super powers can never be satisfied.  They even threaten other countries with their weapons.
However, he said that these super powers that rely on their weapons to bully other countries will soon disappear.
The day when mankind enjoys eternal peace and stability will soon come.
So, we can see this is not merely a battle of words now.  In fact, the mounting tensions between Iran and the West are indeed becoming more and more intense.
Well, since Iran and the US are making no concession to each other in their positions, recently there have also been some format changes.  That is, Iran officially announced the day before yesterday that they will resume their uranium enrichment programs.
In fact, some Western diplomats speculated that they might have actually resumed some procedures for uranium enrichment prior to this.
In addition, Iran also announced that it would postpone its talks with Russia indefinitely.  That is, the talks on Russia refining uranium for Iran.
Well, of course, the indefinite postponement of the talks was also decided based on this new situation.
Well, recently, since the US continues to threaten Iran with attacks, the Oxford Research Institute, a UK think tank, issued this report.
If the US really wants to use force, then half of the people will be dead because of that.  In addition, it will of course trigger, um, may keep this year's wave of violence in the Middle East going on.
Besides, some terrorist attacks will also escalate.
Of course, oil prices will also soar, which is also one of the series of Domino effects.
Furthermore, this report said that if the US fails to subdue Iran, Iran will surely speed up its determination to manufacture nuclear weapons on its own.
Well, we just mentioned the issue of the Russian-Iranian talks.
An Iranian government spokesperson indeed said on Monday that due to the new situation, it would postpone its talks with Russian officials scheduled for the 16th on uranium enrichment in Russia.
However, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that no official notification from Iran was received yet.
So, it is still yet too early to tell whether the meeting will be postponed.
In addition, Russia's Federal Atomic Energy Agency Director Kuchinov said on Monday that Russia is ready to have talks with Iran on the conditions and principle of the negotiations over the nuclear issue.
At the same time, the US New York Times recently published an editorial.
The title of this editorial is also very conspicuous.  It is called Japan's Offensive Foreign Minister.
Well, this editorial specifically mentioned that Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso recently made a string of appalling remarks.
These remarks were all very dishonest and very unwise.  Furthermore, the remarks have triggered widespread indignation among Asian countries.
Well, this editorial also specifically mentioned that Japan should acknowledge its mistakes and learn the lesson rather than avoid mentioning in post-WW II textbooks some of their deeds during the war as they are doing right now.
At the same time, the editorial also said that many of Taro Aso's current remarks, for instance, requesting the prime minister to visit Yasukuni Shrine, for instance, saying Taiwanese colonial rule raised, um, ah, the Japanese colonial rule raised Taiwan's educational level, and so on, it said such remarks were all very appalling.  Moreover, it is evident that he has no knowledge of history and is a very poor diplomat too.
Since the New York Times was the third largest newspaper in circulation in the United States last year, it should be very influential in the US society.
As a result, such an editorial should also be very influential.
In the meantime, some former senior US government officials and some US experts on Asian issues, they recently held a special forum, that is, a forum on Sino-Japanese relations.
Well, at this forum, some experts put forward this viewpoint.
It said that as current Sino-Japanese relations are under great tensions, there may be potential danger of military conflict.
Furthermore, it even said that now there is a greater possibility of a military conflict breaking out between China and Japan than between China and Taiwan.
Er, moreover, once the military conflict breaks out, it will surely drag the US into it because the US will surely get involved.
Well, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson also participating in the forum said that Sino-Japanese relations are now indeed under great tensions.
So, any mistake will lead to serious consequences.
On another note, the Georgian parliament's Defense and Security Committee held an expanded meeting and decided to expel the Russian peacekeeping force from South Ossetia.
The Russian parliament will hold a general assembly to review this bill today.
Er, experts think that if the parliament agrees to expel the Russian peacekeeping force, it may lead to the complete breakup of Georgian-Russian ties.
A spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping force said on the 14th that two of the Russian peacekeeping contingent's military vehicles transporting foods were intercepted by Georgian police with the driver expelled.
Er, the spokesperson called for Georgia to stop immediately such provocations; otherwise Russia would assume no responsibility for the consequences of the incident.
Two military vehicles belonging to the logistic system of the Russian peacekeeping contingent transporting foods and groceries were examined by Georgian police Monday night in Georgia's South Ossetia.
Georgian law enforcement personnel on duty expelled the Russian driver and escorting personnel and forcibly drove away the two military vehicles.
The incident greatly angered the Russian peacekeeping force.
A spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping force said that on February 1, Georgian police detained a Russian military vehicle in the area on an excuse of a traffic accident and has not returned it so far.
On February 8, three Russian military officers were detained for two days and nights on grounds of visa problems.
Georgia's reckless provocations were aimed to incur bloodshed in the area by forcing the Russian troops to open fire so that it could achieve the goal of the withdrawal of the peacekeeping force from South Ossetia.
On that day, the Russian embassy in Georgia made serious representations to the Georgian side, demanding Georgia to immediately stop frenzied provocations; otherwise the Russian side will not assume any consequence of the resulting conflict.
The media noted that on February 13, Georgian Defense Minister Okruashvili announced that the head of the Russian military base in Akhalkalaki sold several Strela portable air defense missile systems to South Ossetia.
On that day, the Georgian parliament Defense and Security Committee held an expanded meeting to hear a report by the law enforcement agency.  It decided to expel the Russian peacekeeping troops in Georgia and called for a review of this issue at the general assembly on the 14th.
Experts think that the final decision, once passed, may eventually lead to the complete breakup of Georgian-Russian ties.
Earlier, Georgian Foreign Minister Bezhuashvili vehemently criticized the Russian position and refuted Russian President Putin's remark that Russia may recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia should the West recognize Kosovo.  He thinks that Russian authorities are sending an encouraging signal to all secessionist districts.
The Russian Foreign Ministry also announced earlier that it would protect Russian citizens in South Ossetia, implying a direct threat of military force to Georgia.

US Pacific Fleet Commander Roughead announced on Tuesday that this summer the United States will deploy four aircraft carriers to conduct the largest-ever military exercise in the Asia-Pacific region in ten years.
Roughead also said that the United States will, er, not consider, um, China, ah, a threat.
The US military is hoping to have another joint exercise with China's PLA Navy.
This declaration of position immediately drew the attention of US defense experts.
Heritage Foundation, a US think tank, held a forum on the Pentagon defense review report on Wednesday.
The subtle relationship between the defense report and the military exercise has become one of the focuses of discussion.
Some, however, think that Roughead's open invitation of China to participate in the military exercise was a sign of US friendship to China.
Since the US military also expressed hope for more transparency in China's PLA operations while inviting China to participate in the military exercise, some defense experts think that this shows the Pentagon's hope to sound each other out through the joint military exercise because it is not sure about the purpose of China's military expansion.
In addition, since the defense review report released by the Pentagon at the beginning of this month considered China the greatest potential threat, the two defense experts also pointed out that the Asia-Pacific military exercise is the first step that the US Department of Defense takes to adjust its strategy on this basis.
Xie Xiaoshuang reporting from Washington for Phoenix Satellite TV.
In addition, this time, this US military exercise in summer is drawing quite a lot of attention, because this is also, ah, the first time in a decade that the US has four aircraft carriers, ah, to participate jointly in a military exercise.  It is also the first time after the Vietnam War that the US deployed the aircraft carriers off the East Coast to do such a military exercise in this west Pacific Ocean region.
Well, this military exercise, ah, is actually very frequent, taking place four times in a few months.
Er, these also include a multinational military exercise.
Well, this multinational military exercise, ah, includes Japan, ah, South Korea, and Australia.
Now let's look at today's headlines.
Some Chinese engineers and technical personnel were attacked by gunmen in the southern Pakistani province of Balochistan on the 15th.
Among them, three engineers from Hefei, Anhui, were killed, and so was their Pakistani driver.
Local police authorities called this incident an open terrorist attack.
Well, the Chinese consulate general in Karachi has already made representations to the local government in dealing with the aftermath and requested the Pakistani side to catch the killers.
This group of Chinese engineering personnel worked in a local cement factory.
On the 15th, they were shot by a gunman sitting on the back seat of a motorcycle on a road in a small town of Hub about 15 kilometers away from Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan.
Two people died on the scene, while another died later due to serious wounds.
The Pakistani driver in the same car was also killed.
The three all came from Hefei City, Anhui Province.
The other three Chinese in the same car with them were spared.  They were not wounded, either.
The Chinese consulate general in Karachi showed great attention to this incident.
After the incident occurred, we immediately dispatched our first-level attache and consulate officials to the construction site where the incident occurred to help deal with the aftermath.
Now we have relocated all remaining 11 engineering and technical personnel at this construction site to the city of Karachi.
In addition, we have also transported the remains of the three murdered compatriots to the hospital in Karachi for preservation.
Er, well, we should say that after the incident occurred, we immediately made representations to the Pakistani government and strongly condemned this sudden attack targeted at Chinese.
We are now requesting the Pakistani side, ah, to go all out to crack the case and seriously, %pw seriously punish the killers.
We are requesting the Pakistani side to take effective security measures to ensure personal and property safety of our personnel and project team in Pakistan.
Following the incident, a local armed organization called the Balochistan Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that the Chinese engineering personnel were killed because they robbed local tribal people of their ore resources together with the Pakistani government.
Police authorities in the province of Balochistan called the incident an open terrorist attack by gunmen to kill innocent Chinese people.
Whereas, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry issued a statement, pledging to strengthen security assurance for other Chinese engineering personnel while accelerating investigation and capture of the culprits.
This comprehensive report has been brought to you by Phoenix Satellite TV.
In addition, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the evening of the 15th strongly condemning the shooting incident that killed three Chinese engineers that afternoon, calling the incident an act of terrorism.
The statement said that the Pakistani government and people strongly condemned the shooting incident that killed the Chinese engineers.
The Pakistani government and people expressed deep respect for the Chinese engineers who had given their lives for the development of Pakistan.
The Pakistani government and people expressed deep condolences for the families of the dead.
The statement also said that the Pakistani government is determined to strengthen protection of Chinese citizens working in Pakistan.
The government will take all measures to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring in future.
The statement also said that the killing of the three Chinese engineers was an act of terrorism in an attempt to create (()) in the relations between Pakistan and China.
The Pakistani government will never allow such attempt to materialize.
Pakistani law enforcement authorities are currently taking steps to swiftly catch the killers and bring them to justice.
In addition, Chinese State President Hu Jintao learned late at night on the 15th about the shooting of the Chinese engineering and technical personnel in the province of Balochistan, Pakistan, which left three people dead.
Er, upon learning the news, he showed great concern over the safety of Chinese engineering and technical personnel in Pakistan.
Well, Hu Jintao, he immediately instructed the Foreign Ministry and the Chinese embassy and consulate in Pakistan to request the Pakistani side to capture the killers, to ensure, um, the safety of Chinese nationals, personnel in Pakistan, er, to properly address the aftermath of the death of the victims.
In addition, Hu Jintao also expressed deep condolences on the tragic death of the Chinese personnel and expressed sincere sympathy for the families of the victims.
All right, regarding this issue, let's now connect with Chen Yiming, People's Daily correspondent in Islamabad, to find out the latest development.
Hello, Mr. Chen.
Please brief us on the latest development of the investigation of the shooting death of the Chinese engineers.
Er, yes, host.
Er, according to what I have learned from the Chinese consulate general in Karachi, er, the Chinese embassy and consulate has already informed the victims' work unit of this tragic incident.
Well, according to the general practice, um, the work unit of the victims should be consulting with the families before making any final decision as to how to deal with the aftermath.
In addition, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry also issued a statement yesterday.
He, er, the statement indicated that the perpetuators of the incident attempted to sow discord in the relations between China and Pakistan.
Er, the statement said that there will be a thorough investigation into the incident and that Pakistan will strengthen security protection of all Chinese working in this country.  In addition, it said that Pakistan will try all it can to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring.
Er, in addition, according to the report by Pakistan's private-run GEO on the evening of the 15th, Bashir, chief executive officer of the Attock cement factory in Pakistan, said in his interview with the station this evening that following the attack, the Pakistani side will try to arrange for the remaining 11 Chinese engineering and technical personnel working on the construction site of the cement project to return to their country as soon as possible.
Well, um, Bashir also said in the interview that with regard to the question of some Pakistani media why the Chinese engineers did not have security guards with them when the incident took place, er, he said, er, actually the cement factory where these engineers worked has its own security system; however, since the incident occurred within the boundary of the factory, none of security guards were with them at the time.
Well, he expressed deep regrets about the occurrence of this tragic incident.
Host.
Eh, all right.
Er, besides, it is actually not the first time that Chinese engineering personnel were killed in attacks in Pakistan.
Such an incident occurred in October 2004.
Two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by an armed group in South Waziristan.
In the end, one of them unfortunately died during the rescue mission.
In addition, three engineering personnel also died in a bombing attack in Gwadar in May of the same year.
Let's have a recap.
On May 3, 2004, in the port of Gwadar in the southern part of the province of Balochistan, Pakistan, a vehicle carrying 12 Chinese was hit by a car bomb while it was driving to the port construction site.
In the end three Chinese engineering personnel died, while nine people were wounded.
This attack was believed to be launched by local separatists and tribal militias.
On October 9 of the same year, two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by gunmen in South Waziristan where Pakistan borders Afghanistan.
When Pakistani troops came to the rescue of the hostages later, one engineer was unfortunately shot to death.
However, armed groups linked with al-Qaeda rather than separatist militants were believed to be responsible for this hostage incident.
Since China has a close economic exchange with Pakistan and participates in Pakistan's infrastructure construction, quite a number of Chinese engineering personnel are working there.
Yet, tribal militias in Pakistan accused the government of robbing them of their natural resources.
Consequently, Chinese people have fallen victims several times to attacks and abductions.
This comprehensive report has been brought to you by Phoenix Satellite V.
Let's look at a few Japan-related news items.
Recently there has been a rather shocking piece of news in Japanese political circles.
That is, Tsuneo Watanabe, chairman of the Yomiuri Shimbun, the number one in the Japanese media, he ordered the Yomiuri Shimbun to publish some articles against Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine.  Furthermore, the Yomiuri Shimbun has since taken a position against Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine.
Er, well, um, Tsuneo Watanabe, he was lashing out against Koizumi in his speech a few days ago, saying he is very ignorant and has no knowledge of any history or culture.
At the same time he also said that visiting Yasukuni Shrine is like singing praises of Hitler.  In addition, he said that by doing so, Koizumi also made China and South Korea consider Japan a very dangerous country.  This is going to have no end of trouble.
Well, why could Tsuneo Watanabe, his attitude trigger great impact?
Actually, he is also very influential in political circles and has been a manipulator behind the scenes all along.
Yet, he used to be a very rightist figure.
We should say he had always supported hawks and also pushed vigorously for constitutional amendment.
But now, ah, this is really a big turn.
He now directed his attacks against Koizumi and started to oppose such a stance.
Actually in 2004 when someone attacked Koizumi for visiting Yasukuni Shrine, um, Tsuneo Watanabe, he still said, he said, er, he supported him and wanted Koizumi to resist the pressure.
However, he gave a speech recently.  He said, I am already more than 80 years old and don't have much time left.
Well, he has now adopted a high-sounding tone and taken on a kind of highly anti-war stance in his speech.
This kind of changing sides by him, of course, has a great social impact in Japan.
Just like Tsuneo Watanabe said himself, he said, I firmly believe I have the actual power of controlling and changing the political orientation.
Furthermore, he also said that should the Yomiuri Shimbun's freedom of speech and freedom of coverage and compilation be under the government pressure, he would resist it at the risk of his life.
Well, what kind of situation has it come to now?
That is, the Yomiuri Shimbun, the largest newspaper in Japan, and the Asahi Shimbun, the second largest newspaper in Japan, now these two large newspapers have started to join hands in opposing Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine.
Originally, these two large newspapers were opponents, but later when the two chairmen met, they at least reached consensus on this issue.
As a result, they now both launched massive attacks on Koizumi, forming what we could call a dream team.
Actually, these two large newspapers of theirs should have a very large influence on Japanese mainstream public opinion.
In addition, let's look at the meeting of Japan's House of Representatives.  At one of their recent meetings, two relatively popular candidates for successor to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made the same remark.
Who are these two people?
One is Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe, and the other is Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso, who has made a series of appalling remarks recently.
What remarks did these two make?
They said that Japan's WWII criminals were not criminals.
What they meant was, er, it was the international court that has called them criminals and convicted them.
Whereas, in Japan, according to the international law, they were; according to the domestic law in Japan, er, the war criminals did not violate the domestic law of Japan.
Therefore, they think that WWII criminals should not be considered criminals in Japan.
At the same time, um, Shinzo Abe, he also mentioned that Japan should now focus its vision on the whole world and develop relations with the United States and develop commercial and trade relations with, um, some east Asian countries.  In addition, it should also try its best to develop close ties with India.  It should not always focus on China.
China's New Management Rules for E-banking Operations to Take Effect on March 1
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 6 (Correspondents Han Jie and Xu Bo) On the 6th, reporters learned from the China Banking Regulatory Commission that the Measures for Administration of E-banking Business and the Security Evaluation Guidance on E-banking issued recently by the CBRC will take effect on March 1, 2006.
A CBRC spokesperson said that according to the rules of the Measures for Administration, relevant approval methods for foreign financial institutions basically remain unchanged, that is, after a foreign bank branch is approved to initiate e-banking operations, if new types of e-banking operations need to be added, the main reporting office in China for such bank branch should submit a uniform application for review and approval.
In order to standardize e-banking operations of commercial banks, the People's Bank of China promulgated the Interim Measures for Administration of E-banking Business in June 2001.
The CBRC spokesperson said that with the continuous development of commercial bank e-banking operations, the Interim Measures can no longer meet the requirements of e-banking risk supervision.  Therefore, the CBRC formulated these two new rules.
According to the introduction by the CBRC spokesperson, CBRC accreditation of security evaluation institutions is different from administrative approvals concerning the entrance eligibility of industries or enterprises.  It is not a necessary condition for evaluation institutions to carry out e-banking security evaluation business, but rather serves as a reference for financial institutions for selecting evaluation institutions.
As long as a security evaluation institution meets the relevant conditions and requirements, even if it does not have CBRC accreditation, financial institutions can still hire it to conduct e-banking security evaluation, though management shall be carried out in accordance with relevant regulations.
The Measures for Administration of E-banking Business include 99 articles under nine chapters, with the nine sections covering general provisions, applications and amendments, risk management, administration of data exchange and transfer, outsourcing business, administration of transnational business, supervision and management, legal obligations, and by-laws.
The Security Evaluation Guidance on E-banking includes 57 articles under five chapters, with the five sections covering general provisions, security evaluation institutions, implementation of security evaluations, administration of security evaluation activities, and by-laws.
On Social Investigations and Studies by Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun Published and in Circulation
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 6  A book entitled On Social Investigations and Studies by Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun compiled by the Party Literature Research Center of the CPC Central Committee has recently been published and put into circulation by the Literature Publishing House of the CPC Central Committee.
Formulating and implementing correct directions and policies based on in-depth and on-site investigations and studies as well as adherence to the combination of theories with realities are basic experiences and methods of the CPC in leading the revolution, construction, and reforms.
Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun and other veteran revolutionaries made many important and excellent remarks on social investigations and studies.  In addition, they often went to the grassroots personally to carry out social investigations and wrote many investigation reports.
The practice and results of their social investigations and studies played significant roles in guiding the cause of the party and the people along the correct path of development.
The book On Social Investigations and Studies by Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun consists of three parts: part one is a selection of quotations on social investigations and studies by Mao Zedong and other veteran revolutionaries; part two consists of writings on social investigations and studies by Mao Zedong and other veteran revolutionaries; and part three consists of investigative reports written by the three investigation teams designated by Mao Zedong in the early 1960s as well as by Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping and others.
Most of these investigative reports were published for the first time.
In addition, there are two overviews on the social investigations and studies conducted by the central leaders during the 1950s and the 1960s.
Russia Reiterates Adherence to One-China Position
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, Feb. 6  During his meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Russia Liu Guchang on the 6th, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alekseev reiterated that Russia adheres to its one-China position.
Alekseev said that Russia noticed Chen Shui-bian's recent remarks about Taiwan independence.
The Russian government has consistently adhered to its one-China policy and firmly supports China's efforts to bring about the grand national reunification.
Last year, after China's National People's Congress passed the National Anti-Secession Law, Russia was among the first to express support publicly.
Alekseev said that the Russian Foreign Ministry will issue a statement as soon as possible to reiterate the one-China policy and oppose Taiwan independence.
(Overseas, China-related) Third Chinese Compatriot Robbed and Killed in South Africa in Two Days
Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, Feb. 6 (Correspondent Chen Ming) On the early morning of the 5th local time, Lin Yixing, an overseas Chinese compatriot from Fuqing, Fujian Province of China, was wounded after being robbed by local armed elements in the pub he operated and died on the early morning of the 6th after emergency treatment failed in a hospital in South African legislative capital of Bloemfontein.
According to Feng Yang, director of the Chinese Association in Free State Province, the incident took place in a pub in the city of Welkom, more than 130 kilometers northwest of Bloemfontein.
At the time, the pub owner Lin Yixing was cleaning up things and getting ready to close the pub for the day.
There were still three patrons in the pub at that time.  One of the patrons took out a pistol and rushed into the pub counter for robbery.
Lin Yixing, who was in his 40s, fought with the culprit, who fired a shot at Lin Yixing before fleeing.
Locals who rushed to the scene upon hearing the news sent Lin Yixing to hospital for treatment.  As his body began to show general diffuse capillary hemorrhage, Lin Yixing suffered continuous bleeding and died at about 3:30 a.m. on February 6.
On February 6, Consuls Xu Defu and Wu Gang from the Chinese consulate general in Johannesburg as well as Lin Changming, deputy director of the China Fujian Association in South Africa, along with others, drove to Bloemfontein to assist the family members of the deceased in dealing with the aftermath.
Lin Yixing became the third Chinese shot and killed by robbers within 36 hours and was also the fourth Chinese killed in South Africa this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 7   The Shanghai Labor and Social Security Bureau released the latest 2006 wage guidelines for hourly workers on the 6th.  The number of job positions reached 120, 11 more than the previous time, while the prevailing wages in previous existing positions had increases and decreases.
According to estimates by relevant experts at the Shanghai Labor and Social Security Bureau, currently the number of hourly workers in Shanghai has exceeded 1 million.
According to a China Youth Daily report, the hourly workforce is mainly composed of college graduates and moonlighters.
A direct survey of nearly 8,000 hourly workers found more than half of them are moonlighters, accounting for 51.1%.
In general, moonlighters have relatively higher levels of education and are mainly engaged in more technically focused work.  For instance, among translation-related jobs, the percentage of moonlighters has reached 81.7%, while it has reached 61.6% for people in fitness professions.
High wages are one of the major reasons for many people to get second jobs as hourly workers.
It was learned that some specific positions such as simultaneous interpreters can earn monthly incomes of tens of thousands of yuan and are also in high demand.  Most hourly workers such as freelance accountants or masters of ceremony at weddings can make more than 2,000 yuan a month.
Satisfying personal interests and expanding knowledge are also major reasons why hourly work appeals to people.
For example, Mr. Gu, a human resources manager in a company, spends a few hours each week doing accounting for the representative office of a foreign company.
Mr. Gu thinks the greatest benefit of the second job is that it allows him to continuously update his knowledge and to have the chance to get involved in another field.  Of course, the monthly income of 2,000 yuan certainly has some appeal as well.
As some hourly positions have low minimum requirements and work styles which are flexible and independent, they are gradually gaining favor among many graduates looking for jobs.  Some 14% of hourly workers are college or technical school graduates from within the past three years.
"At first I didn't want to be an hourly worker.  Yet after working for a few months, I feel it is better than working from 9 to 5."
Xiao Huang, whose job after college was not satisfying, eventually signed up with a hotel to play background music on the piano.
"I am quite satisfied with my current job.  It pays 100 yuan per hour and has a nice environment too.  What I need to do now is find a few more hourly positions."
It was learned that working at hourly positions has become an important approach for some job-seeking graduates to accumulate work experience, practice work skills, enhance communication skills, and increase exposure to society.
Hourly jobs taken by graduates are mainly concentrated in knowledge-based and more technically focused positions.  For instance, specialty focused jobs like those related to translation and trendy entertainment account for 22.1% and 26.8%, respectively.
Some hourly jobs require few skills, such as food salespeople and inventory workers.  Laid-off workers can start work right after minimal training.
Statistics show that among hourly workers, 39% were previously laid-off workers.  Among them, the unemployed working in the retail sector has reached 68.4%, while the percentage in the catering sector has reached 58.7%.  Hourly jobs have become a major channel for the jobless to get reemployed.
Wu Bangguo Inspects Work in Anhui
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 8 (Correspondents Zou Shengwen and Zhou Limin)  While inspecting work in Anhui recently, Wu Bangguo, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, stressed the need to use the important thought of the "three represents" as a guide, to persistently use the viewpoint of scientific development to govern overall social and economic development, to conform with real local situations, to earnestly implement the guidelines and policies of the Central Committee, to enhance liberating thoughts, to innovatively carry out work, to apply a scientific development viewpoint to specific measures and actual work, and to continuously create new prospects in various kinds of work.
From February 6-8, Wu Bangguo visited a series of places such as Ma'anshan, Wuhu, and Hefei, conducting on-site inspections of companies, rural areas, scientific research institutes, and institutions of higher learning.
Wu Bangguo noted that with its geographic advantage linking the east with the west, and the south with the north, Anhui is an important agricultural region in China and that with its rich natural resources, good industrial foundation, relative strength in science and education, and uniquely abundant cultural and tourism resources, it has huge potential for development.

We should foster social consciousness toward innovation, vigorously advocate a brave innovative and competitive spirit, and focus on creating a good environment for people of talent to come forth in large numbers.
Wu Bangguo noted that the NPC is playing an increasingly large role in pushing forth governance of the State by law and construction of a socialist country by the rule of law.
In order to carry out NPC work under new situations, first, we should adhere to the correct political direction, resolutely stay on the road of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics, and organically integrate adherence to the Party leadership, the status of people as masters, and the governance of the State by law.
Second, in initiating work, we should closely embrace the overall plan of the Party and the State, closely embrace the major issues of reform, development, and stability, and closely embrace hot and tough issues that are of general concern to the people, so as to continuously enhance the actual effects of NPC work.
Third, we should put forth the special features and advantages of NPC work, adhere to centralized democracy, carry out tasks in strict accordance with laws and procedures, and decide on issues collectively.
We should adhere to the line of the masses, be people-oriented, empower the people, empathize with the people, and work for the well-being of the people.
China Proposes "Major Research Programs" for Next 15 Years
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 9 (Correspondent Li Xing) In order to enhance China's international competitiveness, vigorously promote a sustainable development, and realize major breakthroughs, four major scientific research programs are planned in the National Guideline on Medium- and Long-Term Program for Science and Technology Development (2006-2020) released by the State Council on the 9th.
The four major research programs cover the study of protein, the study of quantum control, the research of nanotechnology, and the study of growth and reproduction.
The Guideline pointed out that the science of protein is currently the point of keen competition in life science by developed nations.
In the next 15 years, China will give priority to research on transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and structural biology, which are major components of biology system, the biological function and interaction of protein, protein-related computational biology and system biology, methodology of protein studies and related basic application research, etc.
At the same time, the Guideline thinks that the study of quantum control is significantly forward-looking in nature and may cast imponderable impacts on humankind's social and economic development in 20 to 30 years.
China will give priority to research on the principles and methods of carrier and control in quantum communication, quantum computation, new quantum effects of bonded small quantum systems, new principles and technology platforms for the characterization and measurement of quantum control.
In addition, the Guideline points out that nanotechnology, which has become a strategic option for many countries to enhance their core competitiveness, is also one of the fields where China is expected to make breakthroughs.

China has a large population growth.  As many people suffer birth defects, with organs for transplant in seriously short supply, and with the upcoming arrival of an aging era, there is an urgent need for breakthroughs in the scientific theory of reproduction and growth as well as technological innovations.
According to the Guideline, from 2006-2020, China will give priority to the research on the proliferation, differentiation, and control of stem cells, on the creation, maturity, and fertilization of reproductive cells, on the mechanism for degeneration of human reproductive function and retrogressive changes, and on assisted fertility, and the safety and ethics of stem cell technology, etc.
Real Estate Price Increases in Shanghai Retreated by Nearly 7% Last Year
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, Feb. 9 (Correspondent Huang Tingjun) The State's macro-control policies for the real estate sector achieved remarkable results in Shanghai in 2005.
According to the latest published statistics, various real estate sector indexes in Shanghai showed quite significant decreases or slowed increases last year.
Among these, the rate of commercial housing price increase retreated by 6.6% from the previous year, while value added from the real estate sector decreased 4.1% from the previous year.
Pan Jianxin, director of the Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau, recently explained at a press conference that in 2005 the average sales price of commercial housing properties in Shanghai was 6,698 yuan per square meter, up 313 yuan from 2004.
For the full year, commercial housing sales prices rose 9.2% from the previous year, a decline in the rate of increase by 6.6 percentage points year-on-year.
For the full year, the real estate sector registered value added of 67.023 billion yuan, down 4.1% from a year earlier.
Among loan balances of financial institutions, personal housing mortgages were 264.494 billion yuan, a yearly increase of just 19.9 billion yuan, while in 2004, the new increase in loans reached 72.809 billion yuan.
Pan Jianxin said that looking at real estate sales prices for the full year in Shanghai, commercial housing prices remained steady, with some decrease.
The statistics bulletin also showed that based on the latest statistical calculations, in 2005 the rate of increase of real estate prices in Shanghai retreated somewhat, with the average sales price of commercial housing at 6,698 yuan per square meter, up 313 yuan per square meter from 2004.
Property sales prices in 2005 rose 9.7% over the previous year, a decline in the rate of increase by 6.2 percentage points from a year earlier.
According to his briefing, last year Shanghai Municipality completed 124.686 billion yuan in real estate development investments, up 6.1% from the previous year.

The sales volume of commercial housing in the whole year was 216.13 billion yuan, down 4.5% from the previous year.
Two Light Planes Crashed in a Collision in New Zealand
Xinhua News Agency, Wellington, Feb. 9  Two New Zealand light planes crashed in a collision over Shannon about 100 kilometers north of the capital of Wellington on the 9th, causing the deaths of the two students of an aviation school onboard.
According to the relevant official at the local Civil Aviation Authority, the pilots on the two planes were both students from Massey University's School of Aviation.  They were still in training and had not obtained their aviation licenses yet.
At the time of the accident, the two planes were in a non-restricted air zone.  According to the regulations, pilots flying in such zones should be responsible for piloting the plane and safety.
An eyewitness at the scene of the accident told the New Zealand media that he had heard a huge explosion when the planes collided.  He also saw the planes rapidly plummeted toward the ground.
Some other eyewitnesses also confirmed that they had heard a huge explosion before the planes crashed and also saw some plane debris falling down.
At this point the cause of the plane collision is still unclear.  The local CAA will launch an investigation into this.
(Overseas, China-related) Overseas Chinese in Argentina Strongly Condemn Chen Shui-bian's Remarks about Taiwan Independence
Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, Feb. 8 (Correspondent Cao Yu) The Council for Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China in Argentina established by overseas Chinese in Argentina issued a stern statement on the 8th, strongly condemning Chen Shui-bian's recent remarks about Taiwan independence and opposing any attempt to separate Taiwan from China.
The statement said that in his speech made on January 29, Chen Shui-bian claimed that abolishing the National Unification Council and the National Unification Guidelines is another step toward Taiwan independence.
The hope for peace by compatriots on both sides of the Strait as well as Taiwanese compatriots' good wishes for peace, stability, and development will face serious challenges.
The statement noted that at present it still remains the most urgent task for compatriots on both sides of the Strait as well as Chinese communities all over the world to strongly oppose and prevent secessionist activities of Taiwan independence and safeguard peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.
The statement stressed that the Council for Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China in Argentina is willing to unite with all overseas Chinese in Argentina, who are from both sides of the Strait and adhere to the one-China principle, in firmly opposing any form of Taiwan independence and enthusiastically pushing for the peaceful reunification of China.
Chinese Experts: US Playing up "China Military Threat" is Groundless Accusation
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 9 (Correspondents Li Xuanliang, Xiong Zhengyan, and Lin Liping) In the Quadrennial Defense Review that the US Pentagon has officially submitted to Congress recently, China was for the first time called "an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States."
Experts think this is a groundless accusation against China's normal national defense construction.  It plays up "China military threat" and interferes in China's internal affairs.
The Quadrennial Defense Review is the Pentagon's new national defense guideline document.
The 92-page-long report devoted three paragraphs to commenting on China's military issues and the countermeasures the United States should take.  Directly mentioning the two phrases of "China" or "Chinese" 15 times, the report said that "as a major and emerging power, China has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States.  If the United States does not have countermeasures, China will very likely develop disruptive military technologies so as to destroy US advantages in conventional weapons."
Yao Yunzhu, a research fellow from the department of world military studies of the Chinese Military Academy of Sciences, said that though senior US officials expressed similar views on various occasions earlier, this is the first time the United States proposed in its "national defense strategy report" that "China is an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States."
"The report for the first time explicitly refers to Russia, India and China as emerging strategic rivals; in particular, more attention was given to the so-called 'China military threat,'"
said Major General Peng Guangqian, a research fellow with the Chinese Military Academy of Sciences.
Noticeably, on the same day the Quadrennial Defense Review was officially submitted, US President Bush also submitted a government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to Congress, with the national defense budget at 439.3 billion US dollars.
"If the additional budget for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is added, the US national defense budget for 2007 fiscal year will go beyond the milestone of 500 billion dollars, an all time high," Peng Guangqian said. "That is almost equal to the sum of the military spending of all the other countries in the world."
Peng Guanqian thinks that the fabrication of "foreign threats" by the United States reflected the Pentagon's habitual style of "making enemies" and that its real purpose is to secure more national defense funds so that the huge US arms industry groups can fish for more profits.
Experts said that compared with huge military expenditures of the United States, China's national defense expenditures are quite limited.
Deng Hongzhou, a military expert who has participated several times in drafting the white papers on China's national defense, said that China's defense expenditures have somewhat increased with economic development since the 1990s, but the proportion it takes in the State national budget for the same period is on the decline.
Official statistics show that compared with 1979, the proportion of China's expenditures for national defense in 2004 in the State budget for the same period dropped by nearly 10 percentage points.
In 2005 China's expenditures for national defense was 244.656 billion RMB, only about 1/14 of that of the United States.  Its military expenditure per capita was about 1/60 of that of the United States, and its military funding per soldier was about 1/30 of that of a US soldier.
"The United States is equal to China in terms of territorial area, but there is such a big difference in military expenditures.  It is self-evident whose military power is beyond normal defense needs."
Peng Guangqian said.
Teng Jianqun, director of the research department of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, said that the United States should evaluate China's military construction situation objectively and that China's peaceful development doesn't necessarily mean that China and the United States will become military antagonists in the future.
China's 2004 white paper on national defense says that China firmly adheres to the path of peaceful development and adopts a national defense policy that is defensive in nature.
China has never threatened any country in the past and at present, and will never do so in the future.
So far China has not set up any military base in any other country, nor has China dispatched a single soldier to other countries.  In contrast, the United States has established more than 100 military bases overseas and has deployed more than 100,000 soldiers in Asia alone.
Zhu Feng, a professor of the International Relations Institute of Peking University, said that China and the United States should increase communication and exchange through established channels and enhance understanding and mutual trust so as to fully push forward the China-US constructive cooperation in the new century and jointly promote and safeguard world peace and development.
(Winter Olympics) Turin Winter Olympics to Open with Passion
Xinhua News Agency, Turin, Feb. 9 (Correspondents Ding Ying and Yan Tao) The opening ceremony of the 20th Winter Olympics will officially kick off at the Stadio Olimpico in Turin at 8:00 p.m. local time on the 10th.
On the 9th, Turin's Organizing Committee for the Winter Olympic Games revealed in advance to reporters the exciting opening ceremony arrangements.
TOROC President Castellani was full of confidence regarding the opening ceremony.  He said at the press conference that this opening ceremony has cost a total of almost 10 million euros and gathered top talents from various sectors across Italy.
He said the evening of the 10th will be unforgettable, as 35,000 spectators at the stadium along with some 2 billion TV viewers all over the world "will witness a passionate and successful opening ceremony."
Passionate flames, fervent red hearts, the brilliant five rings, peaceful doves, the white snow of the Alps, and dairy cows will all appear at the opening ceremony.  The director introduced: "passion, dynamism, and Italian flair will be the themes of the opening ceremony."  As the largest Winter Olympics in history, it will showcase time-honored and rich Italian history and culture, an energetic humanist style, and the spirit of peace advocated by the Olympic Games.
Famous Italian designer Armani specially designed costumes for the opening ceremony, while famous Italian fashion brand Moschino will provide formal attire for the guides leading the athletes' ceremonial entrance.
However, regarding whether Pavarotti, the famous Italian tenor, will sing a song at the opening ceremony, TOROC will leave the suspense until the end.
Eight "hockey players" with fire erupting from their heads will demonstrate their burning passion with a flame of more than three meters in length as they shuttle back and forth on the rink at a speed of 70 kilometers.
TOROC officials think this is their masterpiece creation for this opening ceremony performance.
Meanwhile, TOROC did not reveal in advance how the main torch will be lit, but at the scheduled time, the 57-meter high main torch will shine on residents of Turin and the nearby Alps.
(International) Bush to Visit Pakistan and India in March as Scheduled, White House Announces
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, Feb. 9 (Correspondents Zhao Yi and Li Xuejun) US White House spokesman McClellan said at a press conference on the 9th that in spite of the strong protests in the Islamic world triggered by the sacrilegious cartoons of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, President Bush will still visit Pakistan and India in March as scheduled.
McClellan said that Bush is looking forward to visiting Pakistan and India.
He also said that arrangements are currently being made for this trip.
McClellan made the above remarks while various kinds of demonstration activities were being carried out in some areas in Pakistan protesting the blasphemy against the Islamic Prophet Muhammad.
When Bush met with Pakistani Prime Minister Aziz in January this year, the two sides said they would strengthen friendly cooperation and jointly combat terrorism that threatens the security of both countries.
Bush also said that at the invitation of the Pakistani and Indian governments, he would visit Pakistan and India in March.
(International Observation) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet
Xinhua News Agency, Ram Allah, Feb. 9 (International Observation) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet
Xinhua News Agency Correspondents Wang Hao and Huang Min
After the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) won the Legislative Council elections, how to draw up a blueprint for a new government has become the current focus of international attention.
What new policies Hamas will push for will directly impact the direction of subsequent corresponding policies by the various parties to the peace process.
In the meantime, resistance by the US and Israel will add to the uncertainty about the prospects of the Hamas government.
At present, various parties in Palestine are accelerating consultations and actively seeking breakthroughs on difficulties and sensitive points regarding future developments involved in forming the cabinet.
(Subtitle) Who Will Become Prime Minister?
After Hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet, some outsiders worried that disagreements could occur between "Prime Minister Hamas" and current top leader Abbas.
In addition, Hamas leader Mashal, who is currently visiting Egypt, stressed that the new Palestinian government led and formed by Hamas will not recognize Israel.  This strong message also increased international concern.
The US and Israel explicitly said that they would not accept a Hamas government which possesses actual power, threatening to discontinue economic aid and tax transfers to Palestine.
However, this did not hinder Hamas from making a flexible tactical adjustment, selecting an independent individual as a compromise.
According to reports, in order to obtain maximum international recognition, Hamas leaders both at home and abroad, who recently gathered in Egypt, decided to select independent Jamal al-Khudairi, board chairman of the Islamic University in Gaza, as new prime minister.
The move has yet to receive responses from relevant parties.
Palestinian analyst Hussein said that no matter who becomes prime minister, the key is that the prime minister nominee should try to downplay the hard-line stance of Hamas.  Only in this way can success in forming a cabinet be ensured.
(Subtitle) How to Divide Power?
Internally, the biggest challenge Hamas faces in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance.
An article carried in the Palestinian newspaper Al-Ayyam analyzed that although Hamas won popularity through its social welfare programs, it lacks experience in governance.  It would be wise for it to cooperate with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), which has experience in governance.
Following the elections, Hamas proposed establishing a "political partnership" with Fatah so as to jointly form a national coalition government.  However, Fatah has not responded enthusiastically so far.
Fatah is currently divided internally with regards to joining the cabinet.  One faction advocates joining the new government so as to make some kind of move, while another faction rejects the Hamas invitation, preferring to be an "active opposition" in the Legislative Council.
Sources noted that under Abbas's persuasion, Fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government.
In spite of this, Hamas and Fatah will still bargain over the distribution of cabinet positions.
In addition, another approach is to form a cabinet outside the framework of the Legislative Council, breaking away from partisan affiliations.
According to reports, Hamas has designed a government exclusively composed of experts, but the specific name list is unknown.
Based on US and Israeli attitudes, forming a government composed of technical experts would also be a good way to relieve outside pressure.
According to the provisions of the Palestinian Basic Law, after the new Legislative Council assumes power on the 16th of this month, the nomination of the prime minister and formation of the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks.
(Subtitle) What About Arms?
The weapons it possesses is another tough issue Hamas faces in forming the new government.
The US and Israel are very firm in their positions, resolutely demanding that Hamas abandon violence and rejecting its armed participation in the government.
Hamas leader Mashal stressed on the 9th that armed resistance is a "strategic choice" of the organization.
The issue of weapons actually exists on two levels, the legitimacy of arms and the affiliation and administration of armed forces.
Hamas won international recognition by being elected the top major party in the Legislative Council through democratic and free methods.  The way to similarly legalize its subordinate armed faction Az A-Din Al-Qassam Brigades is to integrate it into government security institutions.
Hamas had previously proposed unifying armed forces of all factions into a "People's Army" of the Palestinian National Authority, yet failed to get widespread response and was criticized by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (Jihad).
At present, Palestine has more than 60,000 security agency personnel, most of whom come from the Fatah camp.
In addition, Fatah has some loosely organized subordinate armed factions, such as al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and the Fatah Hawks.
Hamas, which is responsible for forming the cabinet, must reach a consensus with Abbas as to how to manage these autonomous armed forces and reasonably divide administrative power.
According to local media reports, Abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence forces, while leaving agencies such as the police and civil defense under the administration of the Interior Ministry of the new government.
However, the various parties are still negotiating over this sensitive issue, with no outcome so far.
China Releases Report on Polar Exploration for First Time
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 10 (Correspondent Li Jianmin)  The State Oceanic Administration has recently released the 2005 Annual Report on China's Polar Exploration.  This is the first time such reports have ever been released since China began its scientific polar expedition activities more than 20 years ago.
The Report gives a comprehensive account of China's polar exploration activities, polar logistics assurance, and major progresses and achievements made in polar scientific research in 2005.
According to the records of the Report, at 22:15 on January 9, 2005 (Beijing time), the Chinese Antarctic Inland Icecap Expedition team successfully reached Dome A area, the highest elevation of the Antarctic Inland Icecap, and at 3:15 on January. 18, 2005 (Beijing time) confirmed the highest elevation point of Dome A was 4,093 meters.
"On the stage of increasingly competitive international polar expedition, the Chinese, relying on their strong willpower and fearless spirit, were courageous to open up new fields and took the lead to challenge the 'peak of the Antarctic Icecap.'  Their single-stroke success realized another dream of human beings in Antarctica."
SOA Director Sun Zhihui said.
The Report shows that on March 24, 2005, China's 21st Antarctic expedition team successfully finished its mission and returned to Shanghai.  The expedition lasted 151 days on a journey of 26,500 nautical miles.
On November 18 of the same year, China's 22nd Antarctic expedition team left Shanghai for the Zhongshan Station in Antarctica to carry out scientific exploration, and it will leave the Zhongshan Station for Shanghai by way of Australia before the end of February 2006.
Since it was the first report on polar exploration China released, the 2005 Annual Report on China's Polar Exploration also reviewed and summarized China's polar exploration that started in the early 1980s.
According to the Report, in 1983, China officially joined the Antarctic Treaty and became a member country of the organization.  In addition, China successively became a member country of a few most influential international organizations on Antarctic affairs, including the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, and the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs.
In 1997, China became a member of the International Arctic Science Committee and won a say in and the right to making decisions in international polar affairs.
The Report noted that after more than 20 years, China's polar exploration "has taken shape out of nothing and continued to grow in scale," forming a "three stations, one vessel" system on Antarctica and Arctic exploration, namely, the Changcheng Station in the Antarctic established in February 1985 and the Zhongshan Station in the Antarctic established in February 1989, and the Huanghe Station built in July 2004 in the Arctic, as well as the "Xuelong" polar scientific research vessel that was put into operation for Antarctic and Arctic exploration since 1994.
The statistics in the Report show that by the end of 2005, China had organized 22 Antarctic expeditions, two Arctic expeditions based on the "Xuelong" vessel, and another two Arctic expeditions at the Huanghe Station.  To date, more than 3,000 scientific visits have been made by Chinese people nationwide to the Antarctica and Arctic for up close and on-site exploration.
"We are now carrying out feasibility study of setting up the third Antarctica scientific station and also China's first inland station at the Antarctic."
Sun Zhihui said.
"After more than 20 years' endeavors, China has got a niche in polar exploration in the world.  However, compared with other major polar exploration countries, there is still a relatively large gap.  We must catch up with them."
He said.
Sun Zhihui disclosed that China will issue a report on polar exploration every year starting this year.
(Overseas, China-related) Castro Meets with Chen Zhili, Stressing Cuba-China Cooperation in Science and Education
Xinhua News Agency, Havana, Feb. 10 (Correspondents Zhou Zhe)  On the 10th, Chairman Castro of the Cuban Council of State met with Chinese State Counselor Chen Zhili, who is visiting Cuba.  Both parties said that mutually beneficial cooperation in education, science, technology, and other fields should be continuously strengthened.
Chairman Castro warmly welcomed State Counselor Chen Zhili's visit to Cuba.
He said that Cuba has a very good relationship with China.  The frequent reciprocal visits at high levels have vigorously promoted and strengthened the mutual friendship and understanding.  He hopes that the two countries will continue to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields including education, science and technology.
Chen Zhili said that Cuba is a country of great influence in the Latin American and Caribbean region.
The friendly exchange between the people of China and Cuba has a very long history.
Cuba was the first Latin American country to establish diplomatic relations with new China.
After entering the new century, under the care and promotion of the leaders of the two countries, mutual political trust between the two countries is deepening, and the areas for cooperation are expanding.  While supporting and cooperating with each other in international affairs, China and Cuba have entered into a new era of developing friendly relations in all aspects.
It is her belief that as both sides make joint efforts, the friendly cooperation between China and Cuba will surely yield even greater achievements.
At the same time Chen Zhili noted that the Chinese government has always attached importance to its exchange and cooperation with Cuba in the area of education.
In recent years, the educational exchange between the two countries has become increasingly close with frequent personnel visits.
China enthusiastically supported the international meetings hosted by Cuba and sent its delegations to each past World Conference on Higher Education and the 2005 Anti-Illiteracy Conference.
Cuba has a very high level of basic education.  It is hoped that exchange of relevant experiences will be further strengthened in future.
Chen Zhili said that as China and Cuba have each their own advantages in scientific research and development, they can achieve mutual benefits and win-win results through carrying out multi-field cooperation.
This time the Chinese side provided Cuba with some scientific research equipment in hopes that they may be of good use to the scientific research and production in Cuba.
She also gave Castro a brief introduction of China's strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education and an account of China's National Conference on Science and Technology.
At the invitation of the Cuban government, Chen Zhili arrived in Havana on February 9 local time, beginning her visit to Cuba.
During this time, Chen Zhili met with Cuban Minister of Higher Education Vecino, and also visited the University of Havana, Cuban Information Science University, Jose Marti Middle School, and St. Maria Elementary School.

A car, a truck, and an oil tanker collided, and the body of the oil tanker cracked, resulting in spillage of the waste oil contained inside onto the road surface.
It was learned that the oil tanker contained waste oil from charcoal production.
Due to the high viscosity of the waste oil and concern for the danger that passing vehicles could spark a fire, the relevant authorities have closed the section of the highway at the scene of the accident.
The section of the highway from Harbin to Shuangcheng was closed, with many vehicles detoured.
The relevant authorities are presently cleaning up the scene.  The cause of the accident is under investigation.
(Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) IPO for Subsidiary 3 Italia Deferred, Hutchison Whampoa Announces
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, Feb. 11  Hutchison Whampoa Co., Ltd announced on the 11th that it will defer the planned IPO of "3 Italia," its subsidiary 3G telecommunications company.
Fok Kin-ning, Hutchison's Group managing director, said that although "3 Italia" has now received all relevant regulatory approvals required to list, it would be in too much a hurry because the procedures for share subscription must be completed in the next few weeks.
At the same time, as current market conditions for European telecom stocks are weak, the market would not necessarily give "3 Italia" an appropriate IPO evaluation at this time.
Considering the best interests of shareholders, it has been decided that the IPO be deferred.
As to when share subscription will start again for the IPO, Fok Kin-ning said it would depend on the future conditions of the European telecommunications market.
He thinks that between now and the IPO, "3 Italia" needs to conduct a broad investor education campaign so that the global telecommunications investors will understand more clearly 3 Italia's current robust performance and its promising future.
According to some other media report, Goldman Sachs, an investment bank acting as one of the global coordinators for "3 Italia," has agreed to hold 10% of "3 Italia" equities in the form of private subscription for 420 million euros.  The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of March this year.
(Overseas, China-related) China-Myanmar Economic and Trade Relations Show Positive Momentum of Development and Promise Tremendous Potential
Xinhua News Agency, Yongon, Feb. 12 (Correspondent Zhang Yunfei) In a special interview with reporters of this agency on the eve of Myanmar Prime Minister Soe Win's visit to China on the 14th, Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar Guan Mu and Commercial Attache Tang Hai said that at present China-Myanmar economic and trade Relations have showed positive momentum of common development featuring rich content, a great variety of forms, and mutual benefit.
Ambassador Guan Mu said that in recent years the neighborly and friendly ties between China and Myanmar, built on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have been solidified and developed.  Exchange and cooperation in various fields are increasingly expanding and deepening while bilateral economic and trade relations continue to be promoted and strengthened.
Attache Tang Hai said that continued reciprocal visits at high level of the two countries have vigorously promoted the development of the bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
During the bilateral high-level reciprocal visits in 2004, the two sides signed 33 economic and trade cooperation agreement documents.  Most of them are now being implemented and carried out.
He said that it was 1.14 billion US dollars in 2004 and reached 1.209 billion US dollars in 2005.  Of the total, China's exports were 935 million US dollars, while its imports stood at 274 million US dollars.
Of last year's bilateral trade, the total trade volume (including the border trade) between China's Yunnan and Myanmar amounted to 630 million US dollars, up 14.6% over the previous year.
Tang Hai said that Myanmar has become one of the major markets for Chinese companies to carry out engineering contract projects.  The main projects China has been contracted to do in Myanmar include power stations, bridges, harbors, and factories (such as sugar plants, textile plants, cement plants, and paper pulp plants), etc.
As Chinese companies carry out their engineering projects in Myanmar, they have also stimulated the export of various sets of mechanical and electronics products by China.  Myanmar has become one of the major markets for China's equipment sets, and mechanical and electronics products.
According to the statistics by China's Customs, in the recent five or six years, the export volume of mechanical and electronics products has accounted for some 45% of China's total exports to Myanmar.
Attache Tang also said that Myanmar is rich in natural resources.  Chinese companies have already started to invest in resource development projects in Myanmar's oil, natural gas, nickel and copper mining, etc.  The potential for the development of China-Myanmar economic and trade cooperation is tremendous.
He hopes that Chinese companies will have a long-term vision, learn to avoid risks, and make careful decisions.  They should set up a good corporate image and win honor to their country by ensuring the quality and timely completion of their awarded contract projects.
Ambassador Guan Mu and Attache Tang Hai both think that Prime Minister Soe Win's upcoming official visit to China, a major event in bilateral relations this year, will be of great significance in increasing mutual political trust, promoting bilateral cooperation, and pushing for further development of neighborly and friendly ties between China and Myanmar.
During the visit, the two sides are expected to sign several economic and trade cooperation agreement documents.
World Bank Plans Debt Relief for Poorest Countries
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, Feb. 11  World Bank President Wolfowitz said in Moscow on the 11th that the World Bank will completely write off debts owed by the poorest countries by the middle of this year.
This day Wolfowitz held talks in Moscow with finance ministers of various countries who have come to attend the G8 Ministers of Finance meeting.
He said in a statement issued after the meeting that the World Bank will implement the debt relief plan before July 1 this year, for which the World Bank is completing all the technical work.
Last year, the World Bank donor nations completely wrote off debts owed by 28 countries and pledged to replenish the relevant trust funds.
The IMF, which is a relatively small creditor, started to forgive debts at the end of 2005.
In addition, Wolfowitz welcomed Russia's decision to write off debts of 16 African countries.
High-definition Digital TV Becoming Mainstream in America
Xinhua News Agency, New York, Feb. 12 (Correspondent Fan Xiaolin) As high-definition digital television (HDTV) prices continually fall and markets expand, US television broadcasters are also increasing their output of HDTV programs.
The recently concluded "Super Bowl" American football game has warmed up the US broadcasting business to welcome the age of HDTV.
According to a Financial Times report the other day, the US Congress recently passed a bill requiring that American broadcasters must discontinue all current analog TV signal broadcasting and only broadcast digital TV signals by February 17, 2009.
This means that the full digitization of US television programs now has a clear timetable.
In order for HDTV to become widespread, it must on one hand depend on consumers to purchase TV sets, and on the other depend on the content industry to supply high-definition digital programs.
Although digital TV has been brought up repeatedly in the past few years, it has still not become reality.
The issue has taken a new turn this year.
According to the US Consumer Electronics Association, this year digital TV sales in the US passed that of conventional TV for the first time, and 85% of the digital TVs were high-definition products.
Japanese Researchers Develop New Type of High-efficiency Artificial Kidney
Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, Feb. 13 (Correspondent Qian Zheng) Researchers at Japan's Tokai University have developed a type of bio-artificial kidney, which not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney, but also the function of preserving useful substances.  In addition it is small in size and easy to transplant.  With further research, there is hope it will bring good news to kidney patients.
According to a recent Nikkei Business Daily report, the newly-developed bio-artificial kidney mainly consists of two parts, an artificial nephron that filters metabolic waste and water from the blood and an artificial renal tubule that returns to the blood the useful ingredients in primary urine, such as water and amino acids.
Both the "artificial nephron" and the "artificial renal tubule" are made of hollow fibers.  In addition, the interior of the artificial renal tubule is fully lined with renal tubular epithelial cells which have the ability to decompose metabolic waste.
The epithelial cells can decompose the causative substance of dialysis-related amyloidosis, a disease caused by repeated hemodialysis, into amino acids and return them to the blood while reabsorbing into the blood the glucose, vitamins, and minerals the body needs.
In contrast, previous artificial kidneys, depending on the difference of osmotic pressures to filter metabolic waste, were unable to remove that completely and nor did they have the ability to return ingredients such as amino acids to the blood.
Researchers tested the bio-artificial kidney transplant on goats, using a pig's epithelial cells to line the interior of the hollow fibers of the artificial kidney.
Two weeks later, researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney had been able to function.
They are presently developing a bio-artificial kidney using human renal cells and will start clinical studies after testing its safety.
Safe Power Production in China Still Faces Serious Challenges
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 13 (Correspondent An Bei) A senior official from the State Electricity Regulatory Commission said on the 13th that although power production safety remained generally stable in 2005, safe power production still faces serious challenges.
At the fifth (expanded) meeting of the National Commission for Safe Power Production held here, SERC Vice Chairman Shi Yubo said that in 2005 China's power production safety was generally stable, while power supply during the peak summer season was successfully and safely accomplished.  Active efforts were made to cope with the effects of natural disasters, and the safe and stable operation of the power supply system was basically ensured.  Accidents involving power production safety infrastructure as well as general power grid accidents were significantly reduced on a year-on-year basis, and the physical condition of power supply infrastructure was improved.
Nevertheless, he noted that along with changes in the power supply and demand situation and the operation of a large number of newly-built power generator units added in succession, safe power production will face new challenges.
Included in these challenges are: regional, seasonal, and periodic power shortages will continue to exist; the power supply and demand situation in some regions will remain quite tight; the lack of a good mechanism for coal pricing for power generation will continue to result in relatively big coal supply problems, while at the same time, the lack of effective control over the declining quality of coal will produce serious impact on the stable operation of power generator units; some weakly structured parts of power grids and outdated equipment may pose hidden hazards to the safety of the system; and the frequency of accidents in power infrastructure construction has yet to be brought under control, with the situation remaining grim.
Shi Yubo said that with the deepening of electricity system reform, many contradictions at deep levels will continue to emerge.  How to maintain a stable working staff and ensure normal production order will become new problems.
With regard to power production safety work in 2006, Shi Yubo said that efforts should be made to further strengthen the basic administration of power production safety; accelerate the establishment and improvement of administrative mechanisms for power safety emergencies; enhance capabilities for handling emergencies; step up coordination and cooperation among power producers and power grids so as to jointly maintain power system safety; continue to effectively supervise dam safety for hydro-electric power stations and to work on developing information networks to ensure dam safety; strengthen safety supervision in power infrastructure construction to reduce accidents resulting in casualties; and continue to enhance information reporting and notification to ensure the accurate and timely flow of power safety information.
It was learned that in connection with the new power safety administration situation, this year the SERC will carry out revision and improvement of the Provisional Regulations on Investigation of Power Production Accidents that were issued.  Meanwhile, supplementary documents concerning dam safety for hydro-electric power stations and protection of secondary power systems will be released in succession for implementation this year.
In 2005, electricity consumption by all sectors in China reached 2,468.9 gigawatt-hours, up 13.45% year-on-year.
Faced with adverse situations such as tightening power supply and demand, and increasing problems with coal, electricity, and oil transportation, various power producers took effective measures, stepping up management of infrastructure.  In all of last year, throughout the country, no exceptionally large infrastructure accidents occurred in power production.
There were 74 grid accidents, down 127 cases year-on-year, and 427 infrastructure accidents, down 132 cases year-on-year.
South African Minister Plenipotentiary in China Says No "Organized" Crimes against Chinese Citizens in South Africa
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 13 (Correspondents Wang Jiangang and Hao Yalin) Minister Plenipotentiary Vusi B. Koloane, charge d'affaires ad interim of the South African embassy in China, said in an exclusive Xinhua interview on the 13th that there are no "organized" crimes against Chinese citizens in South Africa.
At the same time, he said that the South African government will try its best to "crack down on all forms of criminal activity."
Vusi B. Koloane said that the South African government hopes to "reduce to zero" the crime rate and hopes that the life and property of every foreign national working in South Africa will be fully protected by the local law and citizens.
Since 2006, four Chinese citizens have already been killed one after another in South Africa.  Chinese communities have shown widespread concern about this.
In response to this, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has made representations to South Africa and also reminded Chinese citizens in South Africa to further step up vigilance, enhance unity and friendship among Chinese compatriots, and cooperate with police to jointly combat crime activities.
"We express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims."
Vusi B. Koloane said: "We apologize for this and assure the Chinese people that the South African government is earnestly investigating every single case involving Chinese nationals."
According to the Chinese embassy in South Africa, South African police have successfully cracked the February 5 case in which Chen Jianqing, a Chinese woman from Fujian, China, was killed in South Africa.  A suspect has been arrested.
At present police are after another suspect.
Also, according to the disclosure by the South African embassy in China, the criminal involved in the shooting of a Hong Kong businessman in January of this year has been arrested by South African police, with the property of the victim recovered.
Speaking of the impact that these incidents of Chinese citizens being killed may have, Vusi B. Koloane thinks that the incidents "indeed" will have some negative impact on exchanges in trade, tourism, and other fields between the two countries, but the impact "should be fairly small" in the long run.
According to the briefing by Nyembezi, tourism attache of the South African embassy, the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to Chinese nationals going to South Africa in the first 15 days alone of this year.
In addition, according to the Chinese official statistics, South Africa continued to maintain its position as China's largest trade partner in Africa in 2005.
The bilateral trade volume reached 7.27 billion US dollars, growing 23% year-on-year.
However, tourism professionals think that the serial killings of Chinese citizens in 2004 have significantly affected the number of Chinese tourists to South Africa.
According to the statistics of South Africa's tourism bureau, the number of Chinese tourists to South Africa in the first half of 2005 was 20,331, a 14.9% year-on-year decrease.
Currently, some 200,000 Chinese nationals live in towns and rural areas across South Africa.
Analysts here attribute the high crime rate to the large gap between the rich and the poor, high unemployment rate, rampant use of guns, and lack of death penalty in South Africa.
As many Chinese nationals do not understand English and have cash with them or in their homes, they are more likely to become targets of attack by criminals seeking their money.
(Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) Hong Kong Promotes Workplace English Learning and Training
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, Feb. 13 The "Workplace English Campaign" sponsored by the HKSAR government unveiled a new plan on the 13th aimed at enhancing English proficiency of more working people.
The plan themed "enrich life with better English proficiency" includes a series of promotional activities to encourage workplace English learning and training and to further inform employers on how to help employees enhance their English proficiency.
As of now, the plan has sponsored almost 25,000 people, allowing them to complete their workplace English training programs and attain relevant Hong Kong Workplace English Benchmarks for their job types.
The "Workplace English Campaign" in Hong Kong was initiated by the SAR government in 2000.
One of the major projects of the "Workplace English Campaign" is to provide funding for workplace English training.
The plan aims at helping employees who need English in their work to attain relevant workplace English proficiency for their job types through participating in training and taking designated international business English tests.
Hebei to Have Free, Voluntary and Confidential AIDS Testing
Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, Feb. 14 (Correspondent Dong Zhiyong) The "Implementation Plan of Voluntary Counseling and Testing for AIDS Patients in Hebei Province" (Trial Version) recently formulated and issued by the health department of Hebei Province clearly sets forth the guideline that AIDS testing will be done free of charge, voluntarily and confidentially to maximize detection of AIDS and HIV patients and to further implement prevention and intervention measures and the policy of "Four Frees and One Care."
The Plan clearly sets forth the guideline of voluntary counseling and screening for AIDS patients in Hebei Province: AIDS anti-body testing and counseling should be done free of charge; AIDS anti-body testing and counseling should be done voluntarily and with informed consent; AIDS anti-body testing and counseling should be done confidentially without being judgmental to patients' relevant behavior; and HIV and AIDS patients should have the protection of their legal rights and be provided with relevant follow-up services.
The Plan requires that AIDS counseling and testing centers be set up in locations convenient to patients and that individual rooms should be provided for one-on-one counseling so as to protect patients' privacy.
While selecting counselors, full consideration should be given to such factors as personal character, sense of responsibility, scope of knowledge, and communicational skills.
In order to protect the privacy of patients, testing forms can be coded or numbered for registration.
The Plan also requires that health administrative departments above county level should publish in the major local media the list and phone numbers of local medical facilities that provide free and voluntary AIDS testing so that the public can have an easy access to relevant information.
Supervision against Extracting Confessions through Torture Still Focus of Work for Ministry of Public Security
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 14 (Correspondent Meng Na) While answering foreign correspondents' questions at a press conference held by the Ministry of Public Security on the 14th, Zheng Baigang, deputy director of the Ministry's supervision department, pointed out that the so-called "use of inappropriate methods to make criminal suspects confess" is absolutely prohibited in China.
In addition, preventing such problems from happening is a major focus of work for the supervision department.
He also noted that some international organizations do not have a comprehensive and correct understanding of the situation of law enforcement by Chinese police.
The latest data provided by the Ministry of Public Security on the 14th reveal that in 2002 and 2004 the Ministry of Public Security successively issued the Provisions on the Implementation of Detention Measures and Record-keeping by Public Security Organs and the Provisions on Application of Further Interrogation by Public Security Organs, which have more effectively ensured that grass-roots public security organs carry out detention and interrogation measures in accordance with applicable laws.
Since 1997, in order to further push for the "three rectifications" (namely, rectify the extraction of confessions by torture, rectify the abuse of arms and police equipment, and rectify the abuse of coercive measures) police supervisory personnel of public security organs nationwide have been persistently making open and secret trips to grass-roots and frontline law enforcement units such as police stations, criminal police teams, police patrol teams, traffic police teams, venues under the surveillance of public security organs, as well as scenes of law enforcement, to observe components of law enforcement involving citizens' personal safety rights, to check for holes and remedy oversights, to give warnings and reminders, and to stop wrongdoings at the outset.
In order to prevent law enforcement problems where they originate, police supervisory departments have further broadened the scope of law enforcement supervision and stepped up supervision and inspection of components of law enforcement, such as the application of subpoena measures, inquiries and interrogations, 110 police call processing, statistics on case filings, disposal of assets involved in cases, security officers who ticket fines and penalties, and data recording of automobile thefts and robberies.

Heilongjiang to Push Songhua River Water Pollution Ecological Impact Assessment and Countermeasures Project
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, Feb 16 (Correspondent Hu Tao) In order to effectively carry out follow-up monitoring and pollution prevention and control work during the Songhua River's frozen season and thaw season, Heilongjiang Province will actively push for implementation of a Songhua River water pollution ecological impact assessment and countermeasures project.
This reporter learned from the Heilongjiang Environmental Protection Bureau that the "Ecological Impact Assessment of the Serious Pollution Incident in the Songhua River and Countermeasures Project" organized under the leadership of the State Environmental Protection Administration has finalized 15 special topics, which are divided into the five areas of environmental incident response assessment and countermeasures, ecological effects assessment and human health, pollution control endeavors, comprehensive assessment, and technological integration.  The project will be arranged for completion in three phases at specified times.
At present, a total of 60-plus people from ten research universities and institutes in Heilongjiang Province have undertaken technological research on 14 topics.
According to the introduction, environmental protection agencies and relevant scientific research institutions will target five special topics as research topics for environmental incident response assessment and countermeasures, in an effort to prioritize resolution of environmental problems of immediate public concern.
These include concentration of distinctive pollutants at major control sections and predictions of the total volume of pollutants flowing across the border, impact assessment of pollution incidents on the safety of aquatic products from the Songhua River, impact assessment of the safety of river water collected at scattered points along riverbanks and groundwater supplies, research into responsive purification technology for safe urban water supply, and research into rules for governing pollutant deposits and release during the frozen and thaw seasons of the Songhua River.
Environmental protection departments in Heilongjiang Province will also step up environmental surveillance along the Songhua River and strictly investigate and prosecute serious environmental pollution incidents caused by illegal waste discharge and construction.
Heilongjiang will dispatch environmental law enforcement personnel to supervise and guide the comprehensive environmental treatment of small watersheds in various places and improve the environmental management systems on tributaries such as the Ashi River, the Hulan River, and the Tangwang River.
Peking University Sets Up Mourning Hall in Memory of Academician Wang Xuan
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 15 (Correspondent Li Jiangtao) After a few days of intensive arrangements, a mourning hall in memory of academician Wang Xuan set up in the Centennial Memorial Hall at Peking University officially opened at 9:00 a.m. on the 15th.  As of the noon this day, hundreds of people have come to pay their respects.
Some time after 8:00 a.m., a long line of dozens of people formed outside the door before the opening time of the mourning hall.
Inside the mourning hall at PKU's Centennial Hall, this reporter saw a black banner hanging from the wall of the hall which read "Deep Condolences for Academician Wang Xuan."
Beneath the banner was a huge 10-plus square meter portrait of Wang Xuan.  Wearing a pair of glasses, he looked scholarly with a gentle smile on his face.
The portrait was flanked by several cypress trees and dozens of wreaths.
One of the wreaths had this elegiac couplet: "Originated in the Qin, thriving in the Tang, a good foundation was laid in China; bidding farewell to lead type, ushering in electronic type, the modern Bi Sheng drew up the blueprint."
The mourning hall was ensconced in funereal music in a solemn and heavy atmosphere.
Among the mourners were leaders, teachers, and students from PKU as well as Wang Xuan's friends, colleagues, students, and neighbors.  In addition, many people not acquainted with him at all also made special effort to come.
Some of them held fresh flowers in their arms, while some carried flower baskets.  All had small white flowers pinned on their chests.  Slowly they walked up to the portrait of academician Wang Xuan and bowed to express their condolences.
Many people could not hold back tears.
Zhang Wenbin, former director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage and a PKU alumnus, told reporters that more than ten years ago, when he was still working in Henan Province, he once invited Professor Wang Xuan to give a report on scientific and technological innovation to provincial Party committee cadres.
"Academician Wang Xuan set a very good example for us both in character and academic discipline.  He made great contributions to the country and society.  People will never forget him."
Professor Jin Ruilin from PKU Law School was Wang Xuan's old friend and neighbor for more than four decades.
Just discharged from the hospital a few days ago, he insisted on coming to say farewell to his old friend today.
As he left a message in the remembrance book, Mr. Jin could not contain his sadness and wiped away flowing tears several times with tissues.
He told reporters that Professor Wang lived a very simple life.  "He was already a professor with high achievements when he lived in Tongfu Garden, but he stayed in a very small flat for many years.
Later he moved into Chengze Garden and stayed in a unit of about 70 or 80 square meters for more than ten years.
When PKU assigned him to a large unit of over 140 square meters in the Academician Building in Lanqiying, he did not want it.  He did not take the high-rise unit provided at Fangzheng Building either."
Mr. Jin recalled with deep emotion that during Wang Xuan's visits abroad, he was given great offers to stay abroad, but he resolutely refused them all.
"At first he insisted on not applying for the title of academician.  It was only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan's repeated pleas that he filled out the form."
What also deeply touched Mr. Jin was Wang Xuan's attitude toward young people.  "He himself emphasized many times, what can be achieved by looking at myself now, not at myself, on the contrary, I should mentor young people."
Mr. Jin said that Wang Xuan started to focus on mentoring young people when he was in his 50s.  He constantly stressed that he wanted to pave the way for young people and that he wanted to be their stepping stone.
"It is really not easy for a scientist with great accomplishments to do this."
This reporter learned from the PKU News Center that the mourning hall in memory of academician Wang Xuan is open to the public for people of all walks of life to pay their respects from 9:00 a.m. to 16:00 every day, starting from 9:00 on the morning of February 15 through noon on the 19th.
Known as "the modern Bi Sheng," Professor Wang Xuan of Peking University, vice chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and an academician of the Third World Academy of Sciences, passed away at 11:03 on February 13 after medical treatments failed at Union Hospital in Beijing.  He was 70.
(Foreign Affairs) China's NPC Establishes Exchange Mechanism with National Congress of Chile
Wu Bangguo Attends Signing Ceremony and Inks the Agreement
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 15 (Correspondent Rong Yan) On the afternoon of the 15th, in the Great Hall of the People, Chairman Wu Bangguo of the NPC Standing Committee attended the signing ceremony for the agreement on establishing a political dialogue relationship between China's NPC and the National Congress of Chile and inked the agreement document.
The exchange mechanism between China's NPC and the National Congress of Chile has been officially established.
According to sources, Chilean Senate President Romero and Chamber of Deputies President Ascencio have recently signed the agreement in the Chilean capital of Santiago.
According to the provisions of the agreement, the two sides will set up a political dialogue relationship between China's NPC and the National Congress of Chile based on the principle set forth in the communique on establishing diplomatic relations between China and Chile.  The two sides will establish a dialogue commission and hold non-periodic rotating meetings in the two countries to jointly promote the overall development of bilateral relations.
Chilean Ambassador to China Cabrera among others attended the signing ceremony.
China to Issue Information Network Publishing Rights Protection Rules
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 15 (Correspondents Zhou Wei and Li Fei) At present, many websites rely on republishing large quantities of news reports from newspapers and magazines to increase their hit rates, but many are not authorized to do so and have not paid any fees.  In response to this, Wang Ziqiang, director of the copyright division of the National Copyright Administration, said at a press conference held by the Information Office of the State Council on the 15th that regarding the issue of paying for republishing works online, the Information Network Publishing Rights Protection Rules to be issued by the State Council will provide the answers.
Wang Ziqiang said that according to the provisions of the current law, as long as authors do not make a statement prohibiting use, newspapers and magazines can use works already published in newspapers and magazines without the consent of authors while paying compensation.  The National Copyright Administration has specifically set forth the compensation standards for republishing by newspapers and magazines in accordance with the provisions of the law.
However, according to the provisions of the current law, newspaper and magazine publishers have this legal right while no such legal permission is given to the internet at this time.
According to the relevant legal interpretation given by the Supreme People's Court, the legal permission to republish given to newspapers and magazines can be applied to the internet, that is, as long as authors do not make a statement prohibiting use, small articles published in newspapers, magazines, and on the internet can be used online without permission while compensations are made.
However, since the legal interpretation does not stipulate the compensation standards, in reality such works are used on the internet without being given any compensations.
"Whether the legal permission is applicable to these published short works used on the internet still needs to be confirmed legally."
Wang Ziqiang said: "Whether it will be included into the scope set forth by the law still needs to be confirmed by the Information Network Publishing Rights Protection Rules to be issued this year."
(International) Russia's Peacekeeping Mission Not to Be Affected by Georgian Parliament Resolution, Russian Military Says
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, Feb. 15 (Correspondent Song Shiyi) Sedov, an official from the Russian Defense Ministry's press service, said in his speech to the media on the 15th that the Georgian parliament resolution regarding the Russian peacekeeping force will not affect the peacekeeping mission of the Russian troops in the short term and that the Russian troops will continue to carry out their peacekeeping mission in the South Ossetia conflict zone.
Kokoshin, chairman of the CIS Affairs Committee of the Russian State Duma (lower house of the parliament), noted this day in his speech about the Georgian parliament resolution regarding the Russian peacekeeping force that the Georgian resolution will undermine stability in the region and adversely affect Russian-Georgian ties.
He stressed that the Georgian parliament resolution has pushed the relations between Russia and Georgia further toward deterioration.
He thinks that Georgia's accusation against Russia was absurd.
The Georgian parliament passed the resolution this day, calling for the Russian peacekeeping force to stop its peacekeeping mission in South Ossetia but did not finalize the specific deadline for the withdrawal of the Russian peacekeeping force.
The Georgian parliament accused Russian peacekeepers of failing to comply with specified obligations and considered Russia's operation in the conflict zone "an attempt to annex the territory of Georgia."
The Georgian parliament called on the government to adopt proactive actions in considering the replacement of the current Russian peacekeeping mission in the South Ossetia conflict zone with an international peacekeeping force.
The Georgian parliament also called on the government to amend the relevant agreement stipulating Russian peacekeepers' presence in the conflict zone.
South Ossetia is an autonomous state of Georgia, bordering the Russian republic of North Ossetia.
After the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, it announced independence by itself and has been in long-term hostility with the Georgian central government.
At present, Russia has a battalion of 500 peacekeepers stationed in the region.
This contingent was deployed in South Ossetia according to a 1992 four-party agreement signed by Russia, Georgia, North Ossetia, and South Ossetia.
Four People Culpable for Fire in Liaoyuan Hospital to Be Indicted with Charges of Causing Major Accident Due to Negligence
Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, Feb. 16 (Correspondent Zhou Liquan) After a massive fire disaster occurred in the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City, Jilin Province, the accident investigation team ascertained 11 culprits, among whom, four people including Zhang Diankun, head of the hospital electrician team, and others will be indicted with charges of causing a major accident due to negligence.
On December 15, 2005, a fire disaster broke out in the Central Hospital, the largest hospital in Liaoyuan City, leaving 39 people dead in the end.
An area of over 5,000 square meters was burnt during this fire disaster.
It was learned that this is the largest fire accident in the medical and health system nationwide since the founding of new China.
According to the investigation, at about 16:30 on the day of the accident, there was a sudden power outage in the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City.  According to the design of electrical circuit for the hospital, if there was a power outage, the switch of the transformer would be automatically switched to the secondary switch so as to continue providing normal power supply for the hospital.  However, the switch did not make the automatic switch at the time, yet the electrician team leader Zhang Diankun forced the power back on without checking the cause of the power outage, causing the fire disaster.
In addition, more than ten underground cables from which smoke started to rise were tangled together in disorder when such cables should have been neatly and evenly laid out and protected with a fire shield.

Rural Tourism in China: Inaugural Tour in Guizhou Kicks off in Tianlong Tunbao
Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, Feb. 16 (Correspondent Shi Xinrong) On the morning of the 16th, adults and children in Tianlong Village in the township of Tianlong, Pingba County, Guizhou Province, were putting on their festive costumes and had happy smiles all over their faces.
After praying rituals for a good harvest ended at 10:30 in the morning, Zheng Peiqin, an 80-year-old man dressed in a black long gown, kicked off the inaugural tour of China's rural tourism in Guizhou by beating the gong.
Tianlong Tunbao Village is a typical example of rural tourism development in Guizhou as well as a demo area for nationwide rural tourism.
As descendents from soldiers in the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, "Tunbao people" have a history of more than 600 years to date.
Here, people dressed in blue broad-fronted and sleeved gowns are seen everywhere.  The Han culture and attire in ancient China are well preserved in Tunbao Village.
It was learned that taking advantage of this cultural heritage, Tianlong Village started to develop rural cultural tours in 2002.  In 2005, ticket revenues alone amounted to 3.8 million yuan.  More than 47% of peasant households in the village participated in the tourism industry through catering, transport, tourist merchandise sales, etc., with peasants' average per capita income increasing from a bit over 1,300 yuan in 2002 to 2,640 yuan in 2005.
Yang Shengming, director of the Tourism Bureau of Guizhou Province, introduced that following the inaugural tour of the Tianlong Tunbao, as many as 35 various rural tourism events themed "new rural areas, new tourism, new experiences, and new fashions" will be hosted in all parts of Guizhou this year.
To date, various rural tourism programs have been carried out in more than 130 villages in Guizhou.  As of 2005, over 600,000 peasant households escaped poverty through tourism development.

Central Organization Department Calls for Further Expanding Supervision of Selection and Appointment of Leading Cadres and Cadres Overall
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 16  The Central Organization Department recently issued Suggestions for Strengthening Supervision of Cadres.
The Suggestions call on all levels of the Organization Department to supervise cadres in the various components of training, education, inspection, examination, selection, appointment, and day-to-day management, on the basis of strict administration and benevolent protection of cadres.  They should establish to perfection supervisory working mechanism that emphasizes prevention, timely detection, and serious rectification, so as to effectively strengthen supervision over selection and appointment of leading cadres and cadres overall.

With regard to supervision of leadership teams and leading cadres, the Suggestions propose that education on ideals and beliefs, as well as anti-corruption and promotion of integrity, should be persistently carried out.  Such education should be incorporated into the training, selection, management, and supervision of cadres so as to guide and urge leading cadres to enhance cultivation of Party spirit, adhere to the Party's principle of serving public interests and people's welfare, and build up a strong ideological line of defense against corruption and degeneration.
While talking with newly-promoted cadres about their appointments, the desire for integrity and self-discipline should be made clear.
Leadership teams at all levels should be urged to adhere to democratic centralism and to establish and perfect administrative and decision making rules and procedures, so as to earnestly implement a system of collective leadership combined with individual responsibility.
Emphasis should be placed on supervision of chief officials of leadership teams.

Establish to perfection a day-to-day supervisory system for leading cadres, periodically engage in learning and analysis about the circumstances of ideologies and styles of leading cadres, and propose problem-solving suggestions and measures.
Implement a system of warning discussions and inquiry letters for leading cadres, and engage in timely warning discussions or letters of inquiry once signs of trouble are detected.
Earnestly investigate prominent problems involving leading cadres reported by ordinary people.  If problems truly exist, criticism, education, or corresponding organizational disciplinary action should be carried out, depending on individual cases.  Violators of regulations and laws should be turned over to law enforcement organs.  If investigations confirm there have been problems, appropriate methods should be taken to clean things up.
At the same time, integrate strengthening supervision with encouraging cadres to engage in bold exploration and innovation, while paying attention to discovering and praising exemplary cadres.
The Suggestions call on the Organization (personnel) Department at all levels to effectively strengthen supervision of the selection and appointment of Party and government leading cadres.
Further improve supervisory measures concerning components of cadre work such as recommendations, examinations, consultations, discussions, and decisions.

(Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) Taiwan Authorities Heavily Fine Leading High-tech Company on Grounds of Illegal Investment in Mainland
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 16 (Correspondent Chen Jianxing) On the 15th, Taiwan's official economic affairs department decided to fine United Microelectronics Corp. (abbreviated as UMC), one of Taiwan's two giant chipmakers, NT$ 5 million on the grounds of "illegally providing assistance to and participating in the establishment of" mainland-based Hejian Technology Company.
Taiwan's China Times reported that this is the first case of Taiwan authorities fining a Taiwanese business for investing in the mainland since Chen Shui-bian proposed a cross-Strait economic and trade policy advocating "active management and effective opening."
According to reports, officials from the "MOEA Investment Commission" said  that UMC was fined because it violated the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area and the Regulations Governing the Approval of Investment or Technical Cooperation in Mainland China.
In the future, the "MOEA Investment Commission" will also fine former UMC Chairman Tsao Hsing-cheng and others, depending on the situation.
The UMC case originated in February 2005 when Taiwan's prosecution and investigation departments deployed nearly a hundred personnel in raids on the residences and offices of several top UMC officials, claiming that UMC was suspected of illegally "providing funds, technology, and human resources" to Hejian Technology, its mainland investment.
Tsao Hsing-cheng, UMC chairman at the time, subsequently stated publicly that UMC had not violated any regulations of Taiwan authorities and that UMC provided assistance to Hejian Technology in the long-term interest of UMC, since UMC would lose business opportunities if it did not get into the mainland market as soon as possible.
Following that, Taiwan's official Financial Supervisory Commission fined UMC NT$ 3 million on the grounds of violating relevant regulations concerning business information disclosures.
On January 9, 2006, the UMC Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Tsao Hsing-cheng, who a few hours later was officially indicted on suspected illegal investment in the mainland.
UMC, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (abbreviated as TSMC) known as Taiwan's two giant chipmakers, is a leading high-tech corporation on the island.
The series of moves by Taiwan authorities to investigate and punish UMC over the past year have attracted great attention from all sectors of society on the island.
(Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) Second "Macao in My Heart" Essay Competition Calls for Entries from Chinese Throughout the World
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 17 (Correspondent Li Kun) The organizing committee for the second "Macao in My Heart" essay competition announced on the 17th in Beijing that it is calling for Chinese throughout the world to enter essays themed "Macao in My Heart" in the competition.
This essay competition is jointly sponsored by the Macao Foundation and the Baihua Literature and Art Publishing House's Overseas Edition of Essays,  with Chen Jiangong, vice chairman of the China Writer's Association, among others, as chairs of the evaluation committee.
In 2004, the first "Macao in My Heart" essay competition was held during the fifth anniversary of Macao's return to the motherland.  Literature enthusiasts at home and abroad actively responded.  The organizing committee received a total of more than 8,000 entries.  More than 10 winners at home and abroad were invited to the Macao SAR to accept their awards.
Wu Zhiliang, an administrator of the Macao Foundation, explained at the press conference on the 17th that last year the Historic Centre of Macao was included on the World Heritage List.  This not only means that the time-honored lifestyle of Macao people and their mode of community administration are recognized by the world, but also means that Chinese culture and the tradition of "harmony in diversity" and tolerance and kindness are being carried forth and developed in the Macao SAR.  Accordingly, the Macao SAR government decided to establish the year 2006 as Macao's "Year of World Heritage."
Wu Zhiliang said that it is in this excellent cultural atmosphere that the Macao Foundation and the Overseas Edition of Essays of the Baihua Literature and Art Publishing House decided to collaborate again to sponsor the second "Macao in My Heart" essay competition, hoping participants will demonstrate through their works their love for the country and Macao, the graceful and unique culture of Macao, and the new look of peace, harmony, and prosperity of the SAR, so as to further establish the bright image of Macao as a cultural city.
According to the briefing, the deadline for competition entries is September 1 of this year.  The Overseas Edition of Essays will unveil a special column to carry a selection of submitted works.
Following announcement of the evaluation results, an award ceremony will be held in the Macao SAR in early 2007.
Successful Infant Heart Transplant in Shandong
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, Feb. 17 (Zhang Yuqing and Shen Yaoqin) Recently, an infant heart transplant was successfully performed at the Cardiovascular Institute of Jinan Military District.
On the 17th, this reporter saw in the intensive care unit that the infant who had the operation 51 days ago was rosy-cheeked and playing with great enthusiasm with the toys bought for him by medical staff, now that he has smoothly passed the dangerous period after surgery, with all monitoring and test indices normal.
According to an introduction this day by the doctor on duty, when this infant patient from a rural area of Tai'an, Shandong, was brought to the hospital by his parents, he was blue all over and had trouble breathing.  After examination, he was diagnosed with cyanotic congenital heart disease and had to undergo a heart transplant.
Heart transplants are the most difficult, dangerous, and complicated type of heart surgery.
Of special note, no heart transplant on an infant under one had ever been performed domestically.
The Cardiovascular Institute of Jinan Military District assembled experts overnight.  After repeated discussions, a surgery plan and a post-surgery monitoring and treatment plan were carefully designed.  An innovative way to perform vascular anastomoses was developed and experimented on animals.
The surgery officially began at 8:00 a.m. on December 28, 2005.
The donor heart came from an infant who had died of respiratory and cardiac arrest caused by congenital pulmonary hypoplasia.
The surgery involved anastomoses of six blood vessels, with more than 510 stitches no more than 3 millimeters apart.
The surgery was successfully completed after 295 minutes.
State Administration of Work Safety: Prevention of Frequent Serious and Large-scale Coalmine and Other Accidents is Top Priority This Year
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 17 (Correspondent Liu Zheng) With a series of four coalmine accidents each killing more than 100 people, the grim work safety situation throughout the country last year has made "prevention of frequent serous and large-scale coalmine and other accidents" the top priority of work safety efforts nationwide this year.
On the 17th, this reporter learned from SAWS that in order to truly prevent frequent serious and large-scale coalmine and other accidents, coalmines must be the top priority.
With regard to coalmine safety this year, SAWS will effectively carry out the following three tasks:
--Continue to effectively tackle the tough issue of controlling methane.
This year "ventilation first, mining second" will be featured in controlling methane.
If coal mines with high concentrations of methane do not implement "ventilation first, mining second," they will be ordered to immediately stop production in accordance with the law.
--Continue to effectively tackle the tough issue of restructuring and shutting down.
Resolutely and tightly shut down every one of the 5,243 coalmines which have been publicly announced and the other 700-plus coalmines widely reported recently.
Consider shut-downs to be routine work and continuously shut down those coalmines that destroy natural resources, pollute the environment, and do not maintain safety measures.
--Enhance basic coalmine safety administration.
Promptly rectify and halt administrative declines in a handful of large state-owned coalmines and guide small coalmines with chaotic management to set up standardized safety management systems.
In particular, emphasis should be placed on key state-owned coalmines, absolutely prohibiting production that exceeds capacity, exceeds the intensity threshold, and exceeds the established number of workers.
This year's work safety control targets call for a reduction of the nationwide death toll from various kinds of accidents by 3% from the previous year, with a reduction of 3.5% for coalmines.
The number of large-scale accidents causing more than 10 deaths should be reduced by 5%, with a reduction of 7% for coalmines.
People's governments at the provincial level have all been informed of these control targets, which are being passed down to various levels for implementation at grassroots levels and in companies in all localities.
Statistics show that in 2005, 5,986 people died in coalmine accidents nationwide, down 0.7% year-on-year.
However, the number of large-scale accidents causing more than 10 deaths went up, with the death toll rising by 66.6% year-on-year.
(International) Barroso Calls for Compromise by All Parties in Negotiations on Kosovo's Future Status
Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, Feb. 17 (Correspondent He Yi) News from Pristina: On the 17th, European Commission President Barroso said in Pristina, capital of Kosovo, that he hopes all parties involved can be prepared for compromise during negotiations on the future status of Kosovo so as to work toward the eventual establishment of a democratic and multiethnic Kosovo.
After meeting with President Sejdiu of Kosovo's interim authority and representatives of Serbs in Kosovo respectively this day, Barroso said to the media that all parties in Kosovo should adopt a tolerant attitude and establish a democratic and multiethnic Kosovo.  Only a Kosovo that respects the ruling power of the administration and protects the interests of minorities can be acknowledged by the international community.
He also stressed that the European Commission will do all it can to help Kosovo's development.
Barroso also expressed concerns over the difficulties Kosovo currently encounters in the implementation of the eight standards for the democracy process that the United Nations proposed for Kosovo.
He thinks that the implementation of these standards are essential factors that affect the integration of Kosovo with Europe.
He also called on all Serbs in Kosovo to participate in various Kosovo's institutions and to make active contributions to bringing about a democratic and multiethnic Kosovo.
Barroso arrived this day in Pristina, capital of Kosovo, beginning his one-day visit.
Earlier, Barroso visited Croatia, and Serbia and Montenegro.  He will also visit Macedonia, Albania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
(Winter Olympics - Stimulants) News Analysis: Pyleva Case Likely to End Where It Is
Xinhua News Agency, Turin, Feb. 17 News Analysis: Pyleva Case Likely to End Where It Is
Xinhua Correspondents Gao Peng and Ding Ying
Although Italy has said repeatedly that all athletes found using stimulants during the Turin Winter Olympics may face "prison sentences," based on various circumstances at this time, such fate is unlikely to happen to Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva, the center of the first stimulant scandal at this Winter Olympics.
On the 16th, the first stimulant scandal broke out at the Turin Winter Olympics when Olga Pyleva was found to have used carphedon, a banned drug.
The next day the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had been expelled from the Winter Olympics.  In addition, she was stripped of the individual biathlon silver medal for women's 15 km event she won at this Winter Olympics.
On the same day, the International Biathlon Union decided to give Pyleva a two-year ban from the competition.
It has always been the IOC regulation that athletes found using stimulants at the Olympic Games be subject to revocation of their achievements and the eligibility to compete, but they are not subject to legal sanctions.
However, under Italian law, athletes' carrying and using stimulants are considered criminal acts.  Prosecution agencies have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes on stimulants, and violators also face a prison sentence of between three months and three years.
In December last year, after "bargaining" for a year, the IOC and the Italian government finally reached an agreement, under which the two sides will deal with cases of athletes using stimulants at this Winter Olympics in accordance with the Italian law.
Through the untiring efforts of the IOC, the Italian side made concession four days before the Winter Olympics opened, promising that police would not enter the Olympic village to raid athletes' quarters during the Winter Olympics, but athletes tested positive for drugs are still subject to investigations of Italian prosecutors.
Some reports said that Pescante, an Italian government official supervising the Turin Winter Olympics, has already turned over the case of Pyleva using stimulant to Turin's prosecutors.
However, the IOC and Pescante himself so far have not confirmed it yet.
Russian biathlon team doctor Andrey Dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that Pyleva has already left Turin for her country.
Shi Kangcheng, a Chinese sports official who formerly worked at the World Anti-Doping Agency for many years, thinks that once Pyleva returns to her country, this incident may eventually "end where it is."
Shi Kangcheng said that the IOC and the Italian government have never "thoroughly resolved" the anti-stimulant issue at the Winter Olympics.  Even if the Italian prosecution agency really gets involved in this case, the outcome is still hard to tell.
Based on Italy's penalties on its own athletes in the previous cases of stimulant abuse, the maximum penalties violators got were only "two-year deferred imprisonment."
Therefore, Piaili, a senior reporter from the Italian news agency ANSA, said that there is "little" chance that Pyleva will go to jail.  She would just face fines at maximum.
Piaili also said that although the Italian court can hold a trial in absentia, the Italian police will not be able to go abroad to catch Pyleva and bring her back for serving the sentence.
If Pyleva refuses to accept the judgment, the Italian side will not be able to do anything to her.
Comprehensive News: Countries All over the World on High Alert as New Epidemic Outbreaks Continue to Emerge
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 18  Comprehensive reports by Xinhua correspondents abroad said that bird flu continues to spread further on the African continent.
The WHO confirmed on the 17th that birds that died from infection with bird flu virus have been found in three areas in Egypt.
In Europe, the H5 strain of bird flu virus has also been discovered for the first time in France.  Europe and Africa are on high alert and stepping up epidemic prevention measures.
WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Advisor Hassan Bushra told the news media in Egypt on the 17th that dead birds infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus have been found in three areas of Cairo and Giza in central Egypt, and Minya in the south.  Relevant departments of the Egyptian government have already started to slaughter fowls that are suspected of being infected with bird flu.
Experts noted that as Egypt is an important passageway for migratory birds in the Middle East and North Africa, it is highly likely that migratory birds may bring the bird flu virus to the country.
Egypt has announced a ban on the import of live poultry from abroad and stepped up inspection and quarantine practices at the ports of entry.
In Yaounde, capital of Cameroon, more than 800 chickens on a chicken farm died mysteriously in the past week.
Cameroon has decided to immediately suspend the import of all poultry and pork from Nigeria, where a bird flu epidemic occurred, and put a temporary stop on the trade of poultry and related products on all markets along the border between the two countries.
In addition, the government of Cameroon has promptly set up an epidemic monitoring network across the country.  The Pasteur Centre in the country and the State Veterinary Laboratory are on high alert, ready to carry out testing related to the H5N1 virus at any time.
In Europe, Denmark and Sweden preliminarily ruled out the epidemic on the 17th.
The National Veterinary Institute in Sweden released the test results of the dead swans discovered Wednesday, which showed the Swedish swans were not infected with bird flu virus.
The preliminary results of tests by the Danish Veterinary Administration also show that the thirty dead swans recently found within Denmark were not infected with bird flu virus.
However, the agriculture department said that Denmark still cannot afford to be off guard.
Since this year, nine outbreaks of bird flu have occurred in Romania in eastern Europe.  WHO experts said in Bucharest on the 17th that since bird flu broke out in almost all places in the Danube Delta region, the situation must be addressed seriously as Romania may be constantly threatened by bird flu in the next three or five years.
In the Asian country of Bangladesh, the government has taken all necessary preventive measures against bird flu.
The government's Department of Livestock Services has provided relevant books on bird flu prevention to relevant officials and organized domestic fowl breeders for training.
(Magazine and Newspaper Excerpts) China's First Blood Information Sharing Administration System Established in Zhejiang
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 18  According to a disclosure by the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province, China's first blood information and data sharing administration and control network system was officially completed and put into operation at the center recently.
A relevant administrator at the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province said this means that from now on, citizens will be given a unique code after participating in a blood drive with any county (city or district) blood collection/supply agency in Zhejiang Province.  The next time he/she donates blood, just by inputting the relevant code, information such as personal data, blood type, blood donation history, time of the last blood donation, and whether blood can be donated this time will be instantly displayed.
The administrator further explained that if, after inputting the code, the system shows an inadequate lapse of time between blood donations, the system will indicate that conditions for blood donation this time have not been met.
This way not only protects blood donors' health but also more effectively protects blood users' health and safety.
In addition, when blood supplies are tight, priority will be given to blood donors and their families for the use of blood.  You just have to input the valid blood donor certificate, and information about the blood donor will instantly appear.  It is extremely convenient.
According to a report by Hangzhou's Today Morning Express, at present, the information system has been put into use at all 36 blood collection agencies in the province.  Blood resource data at all blood collection/supply agencies across the province have real-time display capability, thereby achieving data sharing throughout the province.
Eleven Villages Urgently Evacuated in Philippines to Prepare against Another Landslide
Xinhua News Agency, Manila, Feb. 18 Philippine local officials said on the 18th that eleven villages in the eastern Philippines were urgently evacuated to prepare against another similar landslide.
Rosette Lerias, a Southern Leyte official, said this day that these villages are located in the same area as the village where the landslide occurred on the 17th and have similar features.
Residents evacuated from the eleven villages will be placed in seven evacuation centers.
Lerias said: "The government ordered residents to evacuate yesterday and sent people to check these villages today because some people were reluctant to leave their homes."
The landslide on the 17th occurred in a hillside village in the town of Saint Bernard in Southern Leyte Province.  The TV image showed that mud and rocks have buried the entire village with only a few rooftops visible.
Since the mud was extremely thick and wet, the chance of survival for those buried underneath was very slim.
So far 109 people have been found dead while another 57 people were rescued.
It was estimated that the death toll from this disaster may reach 1,800.
(Life in Hometowns of Overseas Chinese) First Month This Year Sees Year-on-year Growth of 35.2% in Exports in Southern Fujian City of Quanzhou, Hometown of Overseas Chinese

Championship Hopeful but not Assured
Love Life, Love Luneng
The fire will soon be lit on the battlefield of the Chinese Super League.
Luneng Taishan is getting ready for the new season and preparing to fight again for the championship.
The fight for the championship among Dalian, Shandong, and Shanghai is on the verge of breaking out.
Who will win the championship in the end?
Based on an analysis of strength, although the Taishan team has great hopes of winning the championship, it is not 100 percent assured.
First, new team members have little time to get adjusted.
The Taishan team had four major openings last year.
This year, following recruitment of the two famous national football players Li Leilei and Wang Liang, the Taishan team will soon be joined by two foreign players.  Its strength should be said to have increased without decreasing.
However, since the national team is preparing for matches with Palestine and Iraq, there has hardly been any coordination between the national team players and their teammates.
By the time they return to the team, the Super League will be starting.
Therefore, the problem of getting adjusted is the biggest problem the Taishan team now faces.
In my opinion, the national football players can serve as substitutes in the first few Super League matches.
First, the games can be used as practice to get the team adjusted.
Second, it can allow the players who have just finished two group matches with the national team to take a rest.
After sharpening their skills in several matches, it will not be too late to enter the battle.
The next problem is the hidden troubles on defense.
Last year, the Taishan team's defense was criticized by football fans.
This year, defense has been improved somewhat with the recruitment of Li Leilei, but it's not yet time to rest easy.
The central back still has a problem with turning around slowly, while the substitute players are either slightly old or lack sufficient experience.
If the central back can put forth a stable performance this year, then the Taishan team will have a greater chance of winning the championship.
I think it may be a good idea to use Ren Yongshun, who is in good physical shape.  Despite insufficient experience, he can test himself this year and prepare for the future.
In addition, it is also fine to recall Gao Yao to play sweeper.
There are quite a few members of the Taishan team who can play defensive midfield.  Both Cui Peng and Haibin can play.
Gao Yao, who is physically strong and fierce in intercepting the ball, should be able to do a good job as central back.
Also, whether the foreign players can adjust themselves...
Issues with foreign players have constantly been a big problem for the Taishan team.
Last year, Danciulescu's performance left much to be desired.
I know the foreign players for this year have not been determined yet.
I think that this year, in addition to recruiting an excellent striker, a pure left midfielder should be recruited.
Except for Xing Rui a few years ago, the Taishan team has not had a single true left-footed specialist.
Although Cui Peng and others are all competent, however, a real left midfielder is still much better than a stand-in.
If these three problems can be resolved well, the road to the championship for the Taishan team should be a bit smoother.
As a Shandong football fan, I hope very much that the Taishan team will win the championship this year.
However, to be honest, based on this year's competitive situation, the Taishan team has great hopes but there are few assurances.
Batey Ads Merges with JWT Network, Would It be Too Late to Say Happy New Year?
BrandVista Post:
Hello, everyone.
Once again Spring Festival is behind us.  Our friends who combined their vacation days with Spring Festival holidays are returning to their work.
Wish all friends a Happy New Year, if it is still not too late to say Happy New Year.
When I was chatting with NPLCN in a cafe the other day, he mentioned the current BrandVista.
The website has become much prettier.
The layout of the content is pretty good.
What he likes most is still the recent fully revamped Discuz-based community BBS.
Speaking of the community, I will have to thank one person.
That is Mr. Li Mingshun, general manager of Discuz Beijing company.
If you search for his name on Google, you can get a lot of hits.
I roughly know that he used to be at Sina and later started his own business, an internet ad exchange platform for small and medium-sized businesses, similar to adbrite.com abroad.
At that time he debated on MSN to the effect that Vista thinks that the development of many sectors in China all depends on private economy and growth of small and medium-sized businesses.
However, the situation in this respect in China's markets now is not encouraging.
Therefore, the creative media sector and the similar consulting sector serving small and medium-sized businesses are unable to grow into large scale.
Charging higher fees to facilitate its own development eventually led to an unfulfilling cycle.
Later he came to Discuz.
Discuz is an excellent community software based on PHP and MySQL database.
With the help of Ramboo, a technical engineer in Beijing, the BrandVista community finally saw hope again and emerged with a brand-new look.
The feedback is excellent.
The interface is clean-cut and friendly.
The speed is quite fast.
Writing some texts inspirational both to myself and to others on a freshly clean-cut interface and exchanging details in my work and life with friends of the same aspiration working in the same industry, I started to think this is a kind of happiness.
Thanks, Discuz!
There has been quite a lot of news lately in the advertising sector.
Starting from January, the WTO regulations on the liberalization of advertising went into effect.
Large foreign companies have been arriving at the scene, while smaller foreign companies are getting ready.  Prosperity seems to be everywhere.
Batey Advertising, which originated in Singapore, has encountered quite a lot of trouble.
After losing several heavyweight clients in a row and suffering a series of setbacks in its development in mainland China, Sir Martin finally found some time away from the lawsuit in Italy to think about reshuffling his cards.
Batey Advertising, Batey will merge with the JWT network while keeping its brand name under the JWT management.

Though 141 earlier reported it to OgilvyOne, it would be interesting for Bates Asia to report it to OgilvyOne.

Mom Ten Years Ago
Helen Li
I saw this article and want to share it with you.
This is not out of a momentary impulse but of warmth and kindness cherished long at heart.
I asked myself how I would act if it were me.
The answer was very clear.  I would put down the phone with a "You dialed a wrong number."
I have been thinking this year what exactly can be considered helping others.
I have already given up those momentary actions such as making monetary or material donations.
Two days ago, a friend said, I have already no time to take care of myself.  Even if I want to help others, I will not have the energy to do it.
Wish you a pleasant day :)

Mom Ten Years Ago
On that day ten years ago, when this teacher was taking a nap at home during noontime break, the telephone rang suddenly.
She picked up the phone and listened, yet out came a strange rough voice: "We have caught your kid stealing a book.  Come here quick!"
Coming from the other end of the line was a little girl's crying， along with loud scolding voices of others.
Glancing over at her only daughter, who was watching TV nearby, it suddenly dawned upon her.
Obviously, a little girl must have got caught by the sales person while she was stealing a book.  As she did not want to let her family know it, she must have made up a phone number at random.  That was how they happened to call here.
Of course she could put down the phone and ignored the call.  She could also even reprimand the other party,
because this incident had nothing to do with her.
However, being a teacher, she thought she might be her own student.
The phone call gave her some rough idea that the little girl, who made the momentary slip, must be very much frightened and was facing perhaps the most horrifying situation in her life.
Hesitating for a moment, an idea suddenly occurred to her.  Right, just do it this way.
So, after making sure about the bookstore's address, she hurried there.
Just as she expected, a tearful little girl was standing in the bookstore,
while adults nearby were yelling at her in fierce reproof.
She rushed up to hold the poor little girl in her arms.  Turning around, she said to the sales person nearby: "Talk to me.  Don't scare the kid."
Amid the sales person's reluctant mutterings, she paid the fine of about a few dozen yuan before she was able to lead this little girl out of the bookstore and take a close look at that tear-smudged, terrified face.
She laughed and took the little girl home.  She gave her a good cleaning and let the girl go without asking anything.
Before she took off, she made a special effort to tell her repeatedly, if you want to read books, just come to the auntie's place.  There are many books inside.
The little girl, who had still not yet recovered from her horror, took a close look at her and scampered away.  She never reappeared.
Time went by like a rushing stream.  Ten years had passed in a flash before she knew it.
Having long forgotten this thing, she still lived here, leading a quiet and peaceful life.
One day at noon, there was a series of knocks on the door.
When she opened the door, she saw a stranger, a pretty young girl with all smiles on her face and her hands full of gifts.
"Who are you looking for?"
She asked doubtfully.
In her excitement, that girl said a great deal.
Only with great efforts in following the narration of that girl, a stranger to her, did she suddenly realize that she was that little girl of that year.  She had graduated smoothly from college after ten years and now took this trip purposely to visit her.
With her eyes glistening with tears, the young girl said softly: "Though I have never understood even today why you were willing to pretend to be my mom to help me out, I have always felt all these ten years that I want to call you mom."
The teacher's eyes also grew blurry.
She asked curiously: "If I had not helped you, what would have happened?"
The girl's face immediately darkened.  She gently shook her head and said: "I am not sure.  I could have done something foolish and might have even committed suicide."
The teacher's heart trembled, and she started to feel rejoiced secretly.
The decision she made on the spur of the moment that year turned out to have had such an impact on one person's life.
Looking at the happy smile on the girl's face, she also smiled.

When this world is filled with lies and fraud like junk text messages everywhere, Buddha said, if I don't go to hell, who else goes to hell.
If anyone has done this, then congratulations, because he could become Buddha earlier.
Human beings at their birth are naturally good.
Compassion lies in the heart of every human being.
The moral degeneration of the world is getting worse day by day.  People are not what they were in times past.
Perhaps only self-sacrificing Buddha can do some good deeds.
Observation on Military Situation: How Long Would Iran be Able to Hold on Against US Military Air Strikes?
Yun Feiquan
If we liken a traditional war of attrition to making the enemy bleed to death, then modern warfare is firing a bullet right into the enemy's head at the outset, turning it into a "vegetable" with no time to bleed.
The difference between Iran and the US in military power is not in the numbers but in their understanding of modern warfare.
Iran, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq without any distinguishable winner, does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high-tech warfare.
The British International Intelligence Review recently mentioned, after analyzing US military deployments, that US troops are preparing to launch a large-scale air strike on Iran...
The current status of the Iranian Air Force is rather worrisome.
The current status of the Iranian Air Force is very similar to the pre-war Iraqi Air Force in 2003.
The home country does not have the ability to develop modern weapons independently and is also under the arms embargo imposed by the West.
Upon the breakout of war, it is quite uncertain whether the old and outdated planes of the Iranian Air Force could take off and fight the US military.
Currently, Iran's air defense system is chiefly composed of the air force and land-based air defense force of Iran's regular military as well as the air defense force of the Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Among these, the Iranian Air Force is currently about 50,000 strong and has more than 300 fighter planes of various models.
The main plane models are US-made F-4 Phantoms, F-5 Tigers, and F-14 Tomcats, and Russian-made MIG-29s, among others.
The land-based air defense forces are mainly equipped with US-made Hawk, British-made Arrow, and some Russian-made Sam series surface-to-air missiles.
Analyzing the current status of the Iranian air defense forces, Harold Hutchinson, a US military expert, Khramchikhin, a military expert at Russia's Institute of Political and Military Analysis, and others think that looking at the current situation, there are still some holes in Iran's air defense capabilities and its air defense system construction.
Hutchinson thinks that in terms of overall real power, the Iranian Air Force is absolutely not at the same level as the US military.
The large number of US-made fighter planes Iran has are inoperable due to lack of spare parts, upgrades, and maintenance.
Of the F-14 fighters, once considered the trump of the Iranian Air Force, currently only 10-plus can take off.
It is also questionable whether the AIM-54 Phoenix missiles that they carry, which are said to have over-the-horizon attack capability, are reliable in actual battle.
Khramchikhin mentioned that the air defense missile systems that the US provided to Iran in the 1970s and 1980s have lost combat power due to lack of spare parts.
Some other non-system air defense weapons acquired from Russia and other countries are no match for the US military, which is capable of electromagnetic countermeasures.
Scraping it together has an effect on combat power.
The Iranian government obviously also realizes that its fate in war depends on its ability to defend the home skies.  In a last-minute effort to update its weaponry, it scraped together all it could get to reinforce its air defense system.
From what can be seen at present, its methods can be summarized into two.
First, work hard to conceal key nuclear facilities to enhance its capability to defend against attacks.
According to a report by the British newspaper the Times, Iran has concealed the core parts of nuclear facilities such as the Natanz nuclear plant and Isfahan uranium enrichment center as deep as 18 meters underground and encased them with 2-meter thick cement protection.
However, the US military is a step ahead, having seen the effects of underground bunkers during the 1991 Gulf war in defending against air strikes, it rushed development of various kinds of ground penetrating bombs.
After more than ten years of targeted research, the US military now has a complete package of combat methodology and weapons to deal with reinforced underground bunkers.
Iran has recently also bought large quantities of air defense weaponry from Russia.
Since the end of last year, the Iranian government has made successive agreements with Russia to purchase the Pechora-2A air defense missile system, along with 29 sets of the Tor-M1 air defense missile system worth 700 million US dollars.
However, modern warfare is a competition between systems.
The various air strike weapons of the US military were all developed independently by their own country.  Furthermore, after years of real war experience, they have been adapted into a set of impressive and effective war machines.
In contrast, whether the "new weapons" Iran gathered from other countries and put together can become a combat force within such short period of time is still an issue.
Iran is not lagging behind in weapons only.
The Army Field Manual published by the US military in 1982 proposed for the first time the doctrine of "Air Land Battle," which emphasizes attacking the enemy's deeply strategic and high-value targets using air superiority to paralyze the enemy's command system at the start of the war so that the enemy can become nothing more than "meat on the chopping board" no matter how powerful its regular military strength.
In the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 Kosovo War, and the 2003 Iraq War, the US military cared not about how many planes the enemy had but the range of its own Tomahawk cruise missiles.
Although the Iranian government has been preparing for possible air strikes and has started taking measures to enhance its air defense capabilities, Iran, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq without any distinguishable winner, does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high-tech warfare.
Along with the US military's progress in recent years in military transformation work, the US military's air strike operations already completely differ from Vietnam War era carpet bombing, depending instead on various kinds of high-tech weapons and on modern information technology-based high precision and full depth air attacks.
Confronted with such air strikes, it is still unknown how long Iran's land-based air defense system would be able to hold on.

Joining Hands with Google in Battling Microsoft, Dell Charges Software Vendors "Shelving fees?"
Yun Feiquan
Dell Inc. (US: DELL) and Google confirmed on Tuesday that Dell is testing personal computers that have installed Google Pack.
This move may pose a severe threat against Microsoft's (MSFT) dominant position in the PC software market.
Dell press spokesman Jess Blackburn indicated that the company is evaluating Google's software.
After installing this software, PC users can use the software to search the web as well as search for information stored on the PC.
Blackburn confirmed that at this time, the software being tested by the company include a Google-supported Dell homepage, Google Desktop Search, and Google Toolbar.
At the same time, Google press spokesman Jon Murchinson also confirmed that his company and Dell were testing a bundle of software developed by Google.
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported that IT upstart Google was in the process of negotiations with Dell and Hewlett-Packard Co., among others, in hopes of convincing these computer manufacturing giants to include Google software in their PCs.
According to insider sources quoted by the Wall Street Journal, Google may pay up to 1 billion US dollars to Dell over the next three years to achieve this goal.
However, the two companies did not reveal any of the relevant details.
In addition, Hewlett Packard refused to comment.
Microsoft press spokesman Neil Charney refused to comment on the above news.
As of now, Microsoft is planning to release its next-generation Windows operating system search tool and boost its development of web services.
On the day the news was released, Google's stock price again dropped by 4.46% to 367.92 US dollars.
Microsoft's stock price fell this day by 1%, closing at 26.94 US dollars.
Some analysts pointed out that Google is urgently seeking directions for growth outside of web search.  Joining hands with PC giants such as Dell may cause Google to threaten Microsoft's core business.
Matt Rosoff, an analyst from market research firm Directions on Microsoft, indicated that Google is in a rush to expand its revenue sources, which is definitely something Microsoft is concerned about.
However, some analysts are rather unimpressed.
Charles Di Bona, an analyst from market analysis firm Sanford C. Bernstein, pointed out that it is still too early for Google to shake Microsoft Windows' dominant position.
Reporter's note: Google Shaking Microsoft's Throne?
Huizhengyi
Computers have doubtlessly become a necessity for modern people in their life and work.
However, while everybody uses a computer skillfully, only a handful of people actually know the operating principle of a computer.
Just as using a "foolproof" camera, as long as the interface is friendly and software is easy to use, most beginners can equally feel comfortable operating such a black box as a computer.
Therefore, PC's manufacturer-installed original software will often determine the usage habits of most consumers.
It is exactly through this measure that Microsoft commands a solid control of the PC operating system market.
Now, Google, Microsoft's new rival, also intends to have its finger in the pie through this means.
A well-known economics media outfit recently used a very interesting metaphor for this.
"Dell, Hewlett Packard, and other computer manufacturers started to treat their computer products as supermarket shelves and charge software companies "shelving fees."
Winning bidders can have their software appear in the 'critical ten minutes' when users start their new computers so as to guide consumers to use their products.
This mode of charging fees resembles the way supermarkets charge food suppliers shelving fees."
Doubtlessly, this phenomenon indicates Microsoft's control is being loosened.
Microsoft's managers warned Bill Gates that if Google began to pay PC manufacturers to have their computers installed with Google software when they are shipped out, then Microsoft's hegemony will eventually be threatened.
No matter what will be the outcome of the situation, Microsoft's stable and easy days as number one may become history.
After all, it is easier to win the throne than to keep the throne.

Sword of Justice: Prospects for 2006
Author: Sword of Justice
I remember that at the beginning of 2005, Hong Kong's Apple Daily published an article entitled "As Falun Wheel Revolves, its Contributions Rival Those of Government."
The article called 2004 a year of great advancement for Falun Gong.
The article gave many examples of how overseas CPC officials completely lost their manners in suppressing Falun Gong on various occasions, while Falun Gong practitioners told the truth all over the world, making the CPC completely lose face.
However, in comparison with the vast massive wave of withdrawals from the party triggered by the "Nine Commentaries" in 2005, the year 2004 did not seem impressive.
-Well, what will things be like in 2006?
From two incidents that occurred at the beginning of this year, we can probably see some clues about this year's developments.
One is the publication of "Eliminating Evils" by the Falun Gong founder.  This article announced the imminent doom of those who became CPC spies after July 20, 1999.
Perhaps many people are still skeptical about or cannot believe this article.
Yet, whether believing it or not, history and facts will be the proof!
Of course, CPC spies are like rats living in the sewer.
Their "natural or accidental" deaths won't rouse social or public attention.
But the widespread natural elimination of or repentance by CPC spies both at home and abroad will surely produce a powerful impact and shock to the CPC power structure.
Stunned and awed by the power of natural elimination, they will have to seriously consider their route of retreat and survival - withdrawal from the party, defection, or counterattack.
Consequently, "the CPC ultra stable bureaucracy group" maintained by filthy interests will start to shake, crumble, and collapse!
Another incident is the hunger strike protest movement initiated by Gao Zhisheng to safeguard human rights.
This movement, which started suddenly and was not regarded by people as having potential at the beginning, on the contrary received an unexpectedly enthusiastic response from around the world, and a joint response from various sectors and forces at that.
If this movement can become a tie to gather various forces of justice and the suffering masses, making it a widespread success, then there is hope that an external force will take shape from this to serve as the last straw for the unstable, evil CPC regime.
If we say 2005 was a year in which the CPC was destroyed spiritually, then 2006 will begin a phase in which the CPC will be eliminated both spiritually and materially.
With the further spread of the "Nine Commentaries" and the deepening wave of withdrawal from the party, with the internal collapse of the CPC and the convergence of external forces of justice, the life of the CPC devil will officially enter the count-down period.
The intent of heaven and the people is harmonious; the power of God and the people are converging.
The giant sword is pointing directly at the CPC devil.
If we say 2004 was a year of great advancement and 2005 was a year of surging momentum, then what will be the final conclusion for 2006?
I hope it is stunning transformation and triumph!

Xu Zhiyong: A Letter to Li Qun, Linyi Municipal Party Committee Secretary

Subject: Xu Zhiyong: A Letter to Li Qun, Linyi Municipal Party Committee Secretary - Hooliganism May Also Harm Yourself
Mailing station: feel like old friends at the first meeting (Wed Feb 8 13:56:14 2006), this station (yjrg.net)
As of yesterday the Linyi government under your leadership had illegally put Chen Guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days.
You people have colluded with hooligans and underground society in taking illegal custody of a lawful blind citizen for a long time.
You people have cut off the phone line in his home and installed a cell phone interference device in his courtyard.
You people have also beat him and his family members several times.
You people's barbarism has exceeded the bottom line of a civilized society.
In early October 2005, you people acted like hooligans in the underground society and beat Attorney Li Fangping and me, but we put up with it, always trying our best to understand the difficulties you people are in.  We even acquiesced for some time after you people put Chen Guangcheng under house arrest.
However, 165 days have passed.  Instead of refraining yourself, you people even have become more unscrupulous.
You people dispatched regiments of police and hooligans to harass villagers.
You people continued to detain and beat villagers.
You people have gone too far!
Today, as you continue to organize hooligans in the underground society to hem in Chen Guangcheng, I remind you explicitly that acting as hooligans in the underground society may backfire and harm yourself.
Things at the very beginning should have warranted your reconsideration.
Family planning in Linyi ranked at the bottom in the entire province.
It was understandable that you felt somewhat worried as a municipal party committee secretary.
However, you were wrong to think that people in Linyi are so crude that force must be used to implement the national law and policy.
Whose fault was it if citizens did not cooperate with the government's action?
Was it because citizens were crude or because the government has a poor public credibility as a result of its numerous lies and tricks over a long period of time?
If the same action by the government ten years ago did not appear that absurd, don't you think your barbarous action was way out of line in 2005 when the Chinese society had achieved remarkable progress and when the human rights protection had been written into the Constitution?
Why don't you reexamine yourself as to how it was that your Linyi alone dare do such things?
How could it be that your Linyi alone could not implement the law using the means of democratic rule of law?
After Chen Guangcheng and a number of brave citizens reported the truth about the barbarous way of implementing the law, after Teng Biao and a number of legal professionals daring to safeguard citizens' rights got involved, and after the National Family Planning Commission made the conclusion of the investigation, Linyi should have offered a sincere explanation to gain the understanding of the public.
After all, family planning is a tough subject with Chinese characteristics.
People could also have understood your difficulties.
Yet, you people instead adopted an absurd move - catching Chen Guangcheng in Beijing and bringing him back to be locked up.  You even attempted to incriminate him in the name of illegally supplying state secret intelligence.
Don't you think this criminal charge very absurd for a blind person living in a poor mountain village?
In fact, as long as you people have really corrected your mistakes and as long as you people have done a good job, would you be afraid of the criticism by a blind person?
Would you people find it necessary to dispatch tens of people to watch him 24 hours a day and even feel so exasperated as to convict him?
On October 4, 2005, Attorney Li Fangping and I went to Dongshigu Village.  We made our position very clear and hoped to resolve the contradiction.
We proposed that we could talk with your officials first to find out what idea and request you people had.
We offered to help you persuade Chen Guangcheng not to make certain remarks.
It was our hope that you people should not treat a blind person this way and that both sides should make some concessions.
However, your policy makers were bent on having your way, and furthermore, even "masterminded" an incident of beating and illegally detaining us.
Do you think you can scare us this way?
We have not done anything illegal.
We are not afraid of anything.
Although the rule of law in China is imperfect, it is not so bad as to allow lawlessness.
If you think you can scare us by using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society, then you have far underestimated our resolution and willpower.
As long as we want, we have many people who have many lawful reasons to go to Linyi or visit Chen Guangcheng.
You can beat attorneys and scholars once, twice, and three times.  Each time there will be widespread attention and coverage.
Do you people dare to beat us ten times?
Don't you care very much about your official position?
In case someone is injured by beating, is your position really that secure?
Playing some lowly tricks of hooligans instead of listening to our reasonable advice, don't you think this is not only foolish but also risky?
I want to tell you clearly that in China there is a large number of excellent citizens who follow their conscience and abide by the rule of law.
We are not afraid of hooligans and the underground society.
We cannot tolerate the reckless trampling of the bottom line of human civilization.
If you are going to the extreme, we will go toward your batons and sticks with confidence and ease in groups and by turns until the moment you retreat.
You should know clearly that using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society will not be of any good to you.
Don't think you can extricate yourself from those local ruffians and hooligans who beat up villagers as long as you stay behind the scenes.
Finally, I also want to remind you to treat Chen Guangcheng well.
Blind since a child, he graduated from a college of traditional medicine and taught himself law and English.  He once sued the Beijing subway company in the interest of the blind people, and he introduced running water for the villagers.  He is known far and wide as "Attorney Chen."
You people went so far as to have shameless villains create rumors online slandering him and even attempted to convict him of a crime of supplying confidential intelligence illegally to overseas recipients.  Don't you think you have gone too far by doing that?
It is illegal for you people to put Chen Guangcheng under house arrest.  It is also risky to you.
Originally, you people could have released him with no trouble.
Since the barbarous implementation of the law has stopped, how long will he go on criticizing if left unchecked?
But, you people are now continuing to smear your own image.
As long as Cheng Guangcheng is not free, you people will never have peace.
You people have tortured him enough.
If you even want to convict him or resort to further hooliganism, we will never look on with folded arms.

(fwd) Do Chinese People Deserve Democracy?
Explore Road to Peaceful Liberation of China and Advance spiritual Emancipation of Chinese People.
I am very disappointed to admit that the Chinese people do not deserve democracy!
Aren't the people posting here doing just that?
It is just a pity that not many people will read it online (compared with 1.4 billion).
Among netizens, even fewer people are concerned with or participate in topics like this.  I dare say it is less than 1% of netizens!
What's more, this network is equipped with the Golden Shield, the world's largest, most comprehensive, most advanced, most expensive, and highest quality project!
Indeed.
Depressed, disappointed, helpless, even thinking of submission, but if I want to live a human life, who else can I count on but myself to make it happen?
Though man proposes, God disposes; even if I failed...I would think that it is my fault and that I deserve to live like a dog if I have not tried hard for my own ideals.
The very act of working hard for justice will add some beauty to my own life, at least in my own heart, in my self-appraisal.
In fact I don't have to worry about the future of China at all.
That's because the global environment has made it impossible for the existence of a regime that has not held elections for a long time.
This is just a matter of time.
I only lament that the Chinese people have such luck that at turning points of history, they have always been led by devils of an international and monstrous stature on a road to hell along which your bones are beaten and your blood is sucked out of you.  Just to think that some people call glorious the bones of the dead and the puddles of blood along this road, and even force us to be proud of such glory.
Dark night falls everywhere, but it is the longest in the Divine Land of China.
The Qin Emperor plus the sage Confucius brought huge disasters to people.
While the First Qin Emperor openly ruled as a tyrant, the sage Confucius brainwashed in the shadows.
It is not that the Chinese people do not deserve democracy, it is that their democracy gene is gone, having been made to regress.
For a nation that has existed for more than three thousand years, this nation should have long practiced democracy if there was an element of democracy in its national culture.
When a democratic system was established in Athens, when a republic was founded in Rome, when the Magna Carta was approved by the British people, when the French people were issuing the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and when Americans were issuing the Declaration of Independence, what were Chinese people doing?
Before the Mongols took control of the Central Plains, khuriltai were used to elect emperors.  The Manchus long ago had the Council of Princes and Ministers to practice democratic administration.  Why did it all evaporate once they came to the region of the Han people?
Chinese pursue material things and are not interested at all in spiritual beliefs and political rights.
Believe it or not, at the price of a stuffed pancake, Chinese people would sell you their universal suffrage if they had it.
After half a million years, if the Chinese want democracy, the earthquake will surely be coming.  Run if you can!

Dalai's Special Envoys Meet with Chinese Officials behind Closed Doors
CGP Beili
Dalai's special envoys meet with Chinese officials behind closed doors.
The Dalai Lama stressed that he wants autonomy, not independence, for Tibet.
The special envoys of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader in exile, are having closed-door meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing with no details released.
This is the fifth official meeting between China and the Dalai's government-in-exile since contacts resumed in 2002.
However, as always, the two sides met behind close doors with no details revealed.
Reporters said that the two sides held talks several times but so far no substantive results have been achieved.
The Dalai Lama, who is in exile in northern India, said that he wants autonomy, not independence, for Tibet.
The Chinese side refused to comment on the bilateral talks.
However, analysts said that Beijing wanted to have the dialogue partly because it is worried that Tibetans' dissatisfaction with the Chinese rule may escalate should this 70-year-old spiritual leader in exile die.
Cultural Identity
The delegation of Dalai's government-in-exile was led by Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari, who was also chief representative to several previous talks.
A spokesperson for the Tibetan government-in-exile said that the several rounds of talks they had with Chinese officials in Switzerland in 2005 were very "close and frank," bringing hopes for Tibetans.
The spokesperson said that their ultimate hope is to resolve the relevant issues on the basis reached through negotiation with the Chinese leadership so that Tibetans will have the freedom to preserve their cultural identity, which they consider important.

Dalai Lama's Special Envoys Reiterate they do not Seek Tibet's Independence.
The Dalai Lama will go to visit Washington this month.
Prior to the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama's visit to the United States on November 8, his special envoys said that the Tibetan government-in-exile would not demand for Tibet's independence.
Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said in Washington that he hoped the Chinese government would indeed preserve Tibet's unique culture and tradition.
During his visit to the US next week, the Dalai Lama is expected to discuss the Tibetan issue with President Bush in hopes that Bush can urge the Chinese government to give Tibet genuine autonomy.
Dalai's representative had direct contact with Beijing officials for the first time in Berne in July of this year.
"Genuine Autonomy"
Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari noted that in recent years the Tibetan government-in-exile has seen some positive aspects when meeting with Chinese authorities.
The Dalai Lama's special envoys found that Beijing leaders, especially the representatives from the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, were more willing than before to hear their opinions.
However, Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said that the Tibetan government-in-exile still has too many disagreements with the Chinese government and that there is a very big difference between the positions of the two sides.
He said that during the past five years the Tibetan government-in-exile has tried its best to meet the Chinese request for creating a good negotiation environment.
China should also create a good environment for negotiations on the Tibetan issue instead of suppressing the Dalai Lama unrelentingly.
He said that the Dalai Lama does not demand independence for Tibet.  Tibet is still part of China, but the Chinese government must preserve Tibet's unique culture so that "Tibetans will have genuine autonomy."
In addition, Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari noted that some Chinese think the Tibetan issue will disappear once the Dalai Lama dies.
He said that this idea is very dangerous because China will lose a historic opportunity to solve the Tibetan issue once the Dalai Lama passes away.
He said that as long as the Chinese government responds to the requests of the Dalai Lama and proposes a final resolution, the Dalai Lama will not need to talk about the Tibetan issue internationally.
Negotiation And Compromise are Important Democratic Methods! (ZT)
Houze
I just saw a post by a net friend on The Great Spirit: To Old Mr. Guiren.
His/her original words were "negotiation and compromise are important democratic methods, or else, splitting because of disagreements is the failure of democracy!!!  I hope idealistic democrats will pay full attention to this point!"
This bland remark that has not roused interest among any net friends led me to indulge in a train of thought while all sorts of feelings welled up in my mind.
At this time, I thought of ancient China as well as the past of the West.
Seldom posting topics, I could not help replying to the post of this net friend in the form of a topic post.
Let's take a look first at ancient China.
Everybody knows that beginning with the First Qin Emperor, China has constructed a large and unified centralized power system, with all dynasties that followed operating under this political framework.
Although a "double-track system" was temporarily implemented in the Han Dynasty, that is, a political system consisting of a dual coexisting feudal system and centralized power system, after all, there was still a centralized power system in the end.
The effect of this kind of centralized power system under the conditions at that time in history had its progressive side, had its aspect of promoting the development of forces of production.
However, we should also see that the prolonged period of more than 2,000 years of running this system resulted in a lack of creativity, initiative, and activity in local areas, making it even less possible to formulate, based on local conditions, various kinds of regulations and policies appropriate for local development.
The pyramid-like system of government also caused lower-level officials to only look upward, following every detail of orders from higher levels.
Since all local officials in the county government were appointed by the central government, they had no room for coordination and negotiation among themselves, let alone with those ordinary citizens.
When their rights were infringed upon, peasants in ancient China could do nothing but put up with it time and again.
Only when their most basic rights were threatened, that is, when their rights of existence were deprived by widespread famine, tyranny, and natural disasters, would they rise in revolt with sharpened sticks.
Over 2,000 years, several peasant uprisings spread like storms across the country, from the spontaneous Chen Sheng Wu Guang Uprising to the plotted Yellow Turban Uprising, to the Huang Chao Riot in the Tang Dynasty, as well as the one-month dynastic rule as a result of Li Zicheng's uprising.  Except for Zhu Yuanzhang, none achieved victory in the true sense of the word.
Even the Ming Dynasty established this way by Zhu Yuanzhang was still nothing but a rotating replacement of other dynasties, with no change in the system.
Born a commoner with little education, Zhu Yuanzhang implemented ancient China's centralized power system to a sickening extreme.  The brimming vitality characteristic of the Tang Dynasty, born of openness, freedom, and tolerance, was replaced by stagnant lifelessness.
The free speech atmosphere vanished from the land of China for some time.
Human nature suffered utmost suppression.
Everyone became overcautious and dared not talk too much, from fear and trepidation.
The result of this sole successful peasant uprising over 2,000 years turned the Chinese people into subhuman beings for a period of time.
Now let's take a look at the Middle Ages in Western Europe, known as the Dark Ages.
The Middle Ages in Western Europe was a period of one thousand years which came about after Western Rome was destroyed by nomads and had nothing to do with the previous ancient Greece and Rome.
This period was characterized by fiefdoms, namely land fiefdoms.
Landlords at lower levels had more independent power.
Whether they were small feudal lords with territories extending a few kilometers or the nobility of dukes, marquises, counts, viscounts, and barons who appeared on formal occasions, as people of various ranks were able to mutually check and balance and depend on one another, with the conditions and abilities to fight for their legitimate rights from the king, there were scenes of kings and noblemen sitting together for negotiations of their own respective interests, scenes never seen in ancient Chinese history.
They made mutual compromises and concessions instead of overthrowing or superseding other parties by using force.
This way, by means of various kinds of contracts, rights were continuously granted to noblemen and commoners, and with increasing power for noblemen and commoners, the king's rights became increasingly diminished.
In the end, the British queen became only ceremonial, with no actual power.
Democracy was gradually realized through this method!
Let's come back to make a comparison with ancient China, with all power centralized in the hands of the emperor (except for Li Shimin) and with almost no noblemen.  It would be hard for peasants to sit with the king at the negotiating table over a cup of tea and a glass of wine, making mutual compromises and concessions in a relaxed and pleasant manner and formulating contracts to the satisfaction of the two sides.
Under such circumstances, when the right of existence was deprived, the only way remaining was to overthrow the existing dynasty by force and try to replace it.
Consequently, there was a repeated rotation, from the heyday of the Tang Dynasty to the morbidity of the Ming Dynasty.
Comparing Chinese history with Western history, we find there seems to be no Western country where conflict between the ruler and the ruled was as aggravated as it was in ancient China.
In no Western country were peasant uprisings as frequent as in ancient China.
In Western countries, when conflicts between ancient royal households and peasants arose, noblemen and commoners would first think of achieving resolution through negotiations to protect their own interests.  They would make some mutual concessions to gradually win more rights, while force was rarely used.
Understanding this, you will see that even as we enter the 21st century, some democratic "fighters" on the internet, having inherited the idea of the ultra, absolute totalitarian system of the Ming Dynasty,
and also because their bodies are eroded by the poison of the Cultural Revolution, these democratic "fighters" can talk about nothing except annihilation and overthrow.
Yet it is this kind of ideology that is the largest obstacle to democracy, because these people don't understand that negotiation, consultation, and compromise are the most important methods and approaches for realizing democracy.
Cao Xiaoming: Who Foots Bill for Enriching Rural Cultural Activities?
Houze
This Spring Festival, this writer was lucky enough to spend the holiday in rural China and visit some relatives and friends.
While impressed by the rich festive atmosphere in rural China, I was also concerned with the drab cultural activities in the countryside.
This writer found in one village with friends and relatives that previously at Spring Festival each year, this village would spontaneously organize villagers to put on a local theatrical show called "Revolving Lantern."
Both adults and children could play roles in this show based on characters in the Three Warring Kingdoms.  The villagers never grew tired of watching it.
There were several performing teams for "Revolving Lantern" across the township.  They not only performed in their own villages but also visited other villages, creating liveliness through their exchanges.
However, this year this village no longer organized it.
It turned out that a large sum of money was needed for purchasing costumes alone for "Revolving Lantern."  In the past, costumes were bought through fund raising among the villagers, yet they are now too worn out to wear.
Asking villagers door to door for money again, nobody wanted to do it.  Similar situations also occurred in several other villages across the township.
Without the "Revolving Lantern," the village suddenly became cold and cheerless.
Adults started to play mahjong.
Children also started to play poker.
Villagers all said there was nothing going on for this New Year festival.
Setting off firecrackers or playing mahjong has now become one of the major features of the New Year celebration in rural areas.
Meanwhile, gambling persists in spite of numerous bans and is tending to spread further.  Winning or losing as much as 10,000 yuan in a single game has even become commonplace.  In particular, a large number of peasants returning from their migrant jobs outside have become major players at gambling houses.
Their money earned by their own sweat over a whole year thereby goes down the drain.
In addition, gambling-related family disputes frequently occur.  Some even lead to tragedies of divorce and death.
Some peasants say they gamble not only during the New Year festival, but also frequently participate in gambling during the slack season.
There is no place to go if they don't gamble.
It is too difficult to organize some cultural activities, to find some fun in rural areas.
There are neither facilities nor funds, but also there are no people acting as organizers.
However, in this regard, what Jiangxi has done is doubtlessly good news for peasants.
In order to enrich the cultural life of the peasant population, the Jiangxi provincial government, starting in September of last year, not only implemented "theatrical performances funded by the government, operated by the market, supported by townships, provided for peasant enjoyment,"
but is also allocating at least 60 million yuan annually to a special fund for rural cultural enterprises, so as to bring high-quality cultural products to the rural population.
At the start of the new year, 10 million yuan was again added, bringing the total amount to 100 million yuan for the establishment of the special fund for rural cultural enterprise.
Moreover, the "bills" paid with this special fund are for real benefits:
inviting various kinds of professional artistic troupes to stage performances in rural areas, with at least four performances per year in each township;
inviting various movie theater companies to dispatch teams to put on movies in rural areas, with at least six dramas and educational science movies per year in each administrative village;
organizing and carrying out mass cultural activities with local characteristics, with at least 2-3 events per year in each township.
From this "purchase inventory list," it is easy for us to see that the government is not simply providing funds, but trying its best to think about how to use the limited funding to provide what is most needed and to bring value-added cultural enjoyment for the vast rural population.  It has done a real job.
Currently, the vast numbers of peasants are rejoicing about being exempt from paying grain tax to the government.
If the government can do what Jiangxi did to "foot the bill" for enriching rural people's cultural activities, it will be another joy from heaven for peasants.
Furthermore, this "joy" will not only get peasants away from the mahjong table but also get them "active" in cultural activities, which helps add contributions to the construction of new socialist rural areas.
False Alarm: Wang Peirong's Child Almost Got Kidnapped
peirongwangsohu@gmail.com
Wang Peirong's child almost got kidnapped, but it turned out to be a false alarm.
Some time after 9:00 p.m. on January 24, 2006, Wang Peirong's child gave a full account:
On the morning of January 24, 2006, Wang Peirong's child was called out by the entrance guard when she was attending a make-up class in physics in the Xuzhou No. 3 Middle School.
The entrance guard told Wang Peirong's child that three unidentified men said to the No. 3 Middle School entrance guard, Wang Peirong's child Wang Tianjiao has not been home for three days due to her parents' quarrel.
Now her mother has disappeared.  As we are the leaders at her mother's workplace, we want to go inside the No. 3 Middle School to take away Wang Peirong's child.
Wang Peirong's child said to the entrance guard that what these three men said were all lies, and she refused to go with these three men.
With the help of the No. 3 Middle School entrance guard, Wang Peirong's child was not taken away.
Wang Peirong's child called her mother's leader at noon to investigate this incident, and that leader denied having sent anyone to the Xuzhou No. 3 Middle School.
Wang Peirong's child got her father's leader's telephone number from her.
Wang Peirong's child called her father's leader.
Wang Peirong's child said: "Three people came to the No. 3 Middle Scholl and wanted to take me away."
That leader asked: "Why didn't you go with them?"
Wang Peirong's child answered: "I will surely die if I go with them."
After saying that, Wang Peirong's child hung up the phone.
After hearing what Wang Peirong's child said, Wang Peirong felt it was a serious case and reported it to police.
On January 25, the feedback from the police station was that what Wang Peirong's child had said was basically true.
The police station asked the security department of the China University of Mining and Technology whether it had sent anyone to find Wang Peirong's child at the No. 3 Middle School.  The answer was no.
The police station again asked the CUMT security department whether the work unit affiliated with CUMT had sent anyone to find Wang Peirong's child at the No. 3 Middle School.  The answer was another no.
The relevant department asked others to tell Wang Peirong and his family to pay attention to their safety.
After the incident, the leaders of the relevant departments in Xuzhou City took it seriously.
Through the criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, the possibility of child kidnapping was ruled out.
Wang Peirong thanked the leaders of the relevant departments in Xuzhou City as well as the criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau.
This was a false alarm, and the false alarm was probably caused mainly by the No. 3 Middle School entrance guard.
The criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau has now confirmed:  On January 24, three people including the leader from the School of Science, Wang Peirong's workplace, could not find Wang Peirong by phone.  As they urgently needed to find Wang Peirong (Wang Peirong has so far no idea what that was about), they thought of going to the No. 3 Middle School to find the teacher of Wang Peirong's child so as to ask whether the child was in Xuzhou.
Heavy Topics:  Why is There Lower Risk to Engage in Corruption while cost of Anti-corruption is Higher?
http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/ReadFile?whichfile=44796&typeid=39
With the current cadre mechanism and the anti-corruption mechanism, a corrupt official need only worry about a handful of relevant officials who supervise him rather than the vast majority of the masses.
Therefore, once he thinks he has successfully hoodwinked or balanced those few officials who can control his fate, he will feel safe in carrying out his great cause of corruption and wealth accumulation unscrupulously and at will,  disregarding how the people close to him feel.
In contrast, when ordinary people with no power in their hands take the lead in combating corruption at the sight of an injustice, they may likely be met with extremely cruel retaliation and revenge.
Or they may be also politically labeled against and may anytime suffer the fate of dying before the battle has won.
Comparing the two: those who practice corruption take less risk while those who combat corruption bear the high cost instead.

White House Pushes for Nuclear Inspectors to Be Sent as Soon as Possible to Monitor North Korea's Closure of Its Nuclear Reactors
The White House today called for nuclear inspectors to be sent as soon as possible to monitor North Korea's closure of its nuclear reactors.  The White House made this call after US President Bush had telephone conversations with South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun.
White House National Security Council spokesman Johndroe said that the two leaders today had "discussed new developments concerning the US's cooperation with South Korea on the North Korea nuclear issue, and looked forward to the speedy return of IAEA inspectors to North Korea to monitor the shutdown and sealing of the North Korean nuclear reactors."
Johndroe said that the two presidents also welcomed the US-South Korea free trade agreement that was signed +yesterday, and would work to ensure that the congresses of both countries approve this agreement.
Experts believe that the elemental plutonium that Pyongyang has produced over the last 20 years is sufficient to create twelve nuclear weapons.
Hill, the US envoy to the six-party talks, said after a visit to Pyongyang last week that he expected the Yongbyon nuclear reactors would be shut down in the middle of July.
Torrential Rains Hit Western India, 43 People Dead
Western India was battered by strong winds and torrential rains over the weekend.  Some areas saw serious flooding, and all domestic and overseas flights to and from Mumbai, the major city in the west, were stopped.
Relief officials said today that in total it had caused the deaths of 43 people.
From June to September every year, strong winds and heavy rains brought by the monsoon often cause widespread flood disasters and even human casualties in India, a country with a population of 1.1 billion.
In this disaster caused by torrential rains, half of the victims were carried away and drowned in the floods; the others died because their houses collapsed or from electrocution caused by short circuits.
Mumbai, India's financial center, was also affected.
Over just two days on the 29th and 30th, rainfall in Mumbai reached 243 mm.
Mumbai's chief administrator, Pathak, said that in this city alone, 13 people had died.
City officials appealed for the 15 million residents to avoid going out before the torrential rains eased so as to protect their own safety.
Yesterday the rain cleared for a while, but most districts of Mumbai were still completely flooded today.
Nearly 500 People Dead in Monsoon Floods in India
According to reports from officials and the media, the number of people who have died this year in India because of heavy monsoon rains has risen to 474.
The Press Trust of India quoted the government minister for relief and rehabilitation Kadam as revealing today that in the last week, the monsoon has started in all of India's states one after another, and that the financial losses and casualties have been serious in all areas.  Just in Maharashtra, the state which includes Mumbai, India's largest city, the number of people known to have died has now reached 358.
Reports say that Kadam made the above statement to media and journalists as he was making an inspection of Mumbai.
He said that Maharashtra, which is also India's biggest cotton-producing state, was entirely covered with a vast expanse of water, and there were cities and towns numbering 27 and about 2,000 villages which had been hit by serious flooding.  More than 10,000 affected people had been evacuated to safe shelters.
The whole of India, from south to north, started to progressively enter the monsoon season a week ago.  The residents of each state all greeted the heavy rains as relief at the end of a long drought, but didn't expect that the rain would come with unexpected violence, a real deluge.  Highways have become rivers; houses in low-lying areas have been surbmerged in the water; the transport system is nearly paralyzed.  To date, figures show that nearly 500 people have unfortunately lost their lives to the floods.
Wimbledon Tennis Tournament: Djokovic Forfeits, Nadal Through to Final
Spanish clay court master Nadal today played Serbian wizard Djokovic in the men's singles semi-finals of the Wimbledon championships.  At the end of the match, Djokovic was unable to continue to play because he was injured, forfeited and withdrew from the match.  Nadal won and entered the final.  He will replay the titanic struggle for the championship at the French Open against the Swiss king of the tennis world, Federer.
Djokovic called for medics to treat his back injury during the course of both his last-16 and quarter-final matches.  Today, when he had played to the third set, he again called for a medic to treat him because of a blister on his toe.  He later felt that he could not play on with the injury and decided to forfeit the game.
Fourth seed Djokovic's withdrawal from the game allowed second seed Nadal, who was leading 3-6, 6-1, 4-1, to claim the victory and progress through.
Apart from losing the first set after being broken once due to a slow start at the beginning of the match, Nadal was in a leading position throughout the second and third sets.
Satellite Images Show Iran Digging a Tunnel, Feared to be for Protecting Nuclear Facilities
The Institute for Science and International Security, a US think tank, today reported that commercial satellite images have shown that Iran is digging a tunnel in a mountain near the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, which may be for protecting nuclear facilities in the event of air strikes.
The images were taken by US company DigitalGlobe (DigitalGlobe) on June 11 and have been posted on the ISIS website.
The Insitute, located in Washington DC, is a non-profit research organization.
The images show that road building is going on through the mountains just 2.4 kilometers south of the Natanz facility, and within that facility is a uranium enrichment plant.
Analysts Albright and Brannan say in a report that the entrance and exit of the tunnel in the images are not clear, but that "one of the roads seems to lead into a tunnel facility.  The other road may also lead to a tunnel entrance/exit."
They say: "A tunnel facility inside a mountain like this would be of great use in terms of protection during an air strike."
UN Envoy Calls Nuclear Talks, Iran's Attitude Still Inflexible
UN International Atomic Energy Agency deputy director-general Heinonen today held talks with Iranian officials in Tehran, once again trying to break the deadlock created by Iran's nuclear plans.
But Iranian President Ahmadinejad remained defiant under increasing pressure from the UN's further sanctions.
Ahmadinejad asserted that Iran will not stop uranium enrichment, but welcomed these new talks.
He said: "Progress towards the installation of centrifuges can be delayed or speeded up.  This is an administrative issue.  But no-one should expect us to give up our rights.  We will not stop this progress."
He made this remark after Heinonen arrived in Tehran.
Heinonen's aim on this trip is to establish a plan to resolve "the outstanding issues" caused by Iran's nuclear plans.
The UN has already imposed two sets of sanctions on Iran because Tehran failed to freeze its uranium enrichment operation.
The Islamic Republic News Agency reports that Heinonen held talks with officials led by Vaeedi, deputy secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council for International Affairs.
The members of Iran's delegation at the talks also included Saeedi, vice-president of the Atomic Energy Organization, and Soltaniyeh, permanent ambassador to the IAEA.
State of Emergency Period Ends; Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad to Form New Government
The month-long state of emergency declared by the Palestinian authorities after Hamas militants occupied the Gaza Strip comes to an end today.  Prime Minister Fayyad offered resignation temporarily, but was immediately ordered to take responsibility for forming a new government.
Minister for Agriculture and Social Affairs Habbash told AFP: "Prime Minister Fayyad offered his resignation to President Abbas.  The president accepted it and at the same time also asked him to form a new cabinet government to be responsible for routine administration."
Amr, an advisor to Abbas, told AFP that Fayyad had tendered his resignation, but that Abbas had ordered him to "act in his current position until he has formed a new government."
The resignation of Fayyad, who is a highly respected economist, was merely a procedural resignation, and will not affect his position as prime minister.
Fayyad has led Palestine's emergency cabinet since the 17th of last month, being responsible for executing Abbas's state of emergency decree after Hamas's violent occupation of Gaza.
According to the basic law of the Palestinian self-rule government, a state of emergency cannot exceed 30 days without the agreement of the parliament, but the autonomous parliament is currently paralyzed.
The emergency government's authority expires today.
WTO Delegates Propose New Plan, Hoping to Break Deadlock in the Doha Round of Talks
The main delegates at the World Trade Organization talks today suggested that the US make major cuts in its agricultural subsidies and that developing countries significantly reduce import duties on industrial products in order to break the deadlock in the Doha round of trade talks.
Officials say the new "draft models" require the US to reduce its annual subsidies for agriculture from the 19 billion US dollars permitted at present to 16.2 billion US dollars, and developing countries to adjust and reduce import duties on industrial products to below 23%.
These suggestions are aimed at breaking the deadlock in which the Doha round of talks has been stuck for nearly six years, and at bringing the 150 members of the WTO to a compromise agreement.
Director-general Lamy of the WTO called these suggestions "a fair and reasonable foundation for reaching an agreement which has major long-term targets and balance and is development-oriented."
Lamy said: "The member states will not be completely satisfied with the details of the suggestions, but at present the problems causing differences are fewer than  the problems of reaching agreement."
He called for intensive talks to be held over the next few weeks.
Strong Earthquakes Affect Parts Production; Japanese Auto Plants Cut or Stop Production
This week Japan was hit by strong earthquakes, which caused a shortage of auto parts.  Toyota, Nissan and other auto manufacturers said today that they would cut or even suspend domestic car production.
The day before yesterday Japan was hit by a strong earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale.  Auto part manufacturer Riken Corporation was forced to suspend operation of a factory in a northwestern district of Tokyo.  This had a knock-on effect on auto production.
A spokeswoman for Toyota, the best-selling auto-maker in the world, said that Toyota would suspend domestic auto production from tonight till the 21st.
Nakagawa, a spokesman for Nissan, said that from the day after tomorrow until the 23rd, two of Nissan's three factories in Japan would suspend part of their production operations, and that they would reassess the situation at the weekend.
He said that both of the two factories had two production lines, of which one production line would be affected, but the company may increase the number of shifts next month to make up for lost production time.
Suzuki Auto said that it would stop some production for three days starting from tomorrow.  Fuji Heavy Industries Corporation, which produces Subaru vehicles, would also suspend manufacturing smaller vehicles starting from tomorrow, and would assess the situation on the 21st.
Meanwhile, Honda Motor said that next week it might pause operations on some of its production lines that rely on the supply of parts.
This earthquake caused the deaths of at least 10 people.  Over 1,000 people were injured and hundreds of houses collapsed, further forcing factories in affected areas to stop operations.
Worries over Buying Frenzy, Indonesia Cancels Sale of Environmentally-friendly Bags from Well-known British Brand
A sales agent said today that Indonesia had canceled the sale of environmentally-friendly bags from a well-known British brand in the light of the chaos caused by the buying frenzy earlier this month in Hong Kong.
The manager of On Pedder, a well-known store located in the high-end Plaza Indonesia, said: "In the light of the events in Hong Kong, we have canceled the sale of environmentally-friendly bags.
If the public is going to brawl over a 140,000-rupiah (about 494 NTD) bag, then it's not worth that."
Thousands of Hong Kong residents gathered outside the shop selling them on the 6th, ready to scramble for the limited-edition, environmentally-friendly bags, which were designed by British designer Anya Hindmarch and are printed with "I am not a plastic bag."  But the shop staff refused to open the doors, causing the situation to get out of control.
These top-end products, aimed at protecting the environment, are attempting to replace plastic bags, and unexpectedly became a fashion symbol instantly in London and New York.  They have triggered a buying frenzy as the price on auction website eBay has soared to many times the retail price.
On Pedder, the only authorized vendor in Indonesia, said that it was not sure whether or not it would begin the sale in a few days.
Hostage Crisis Countdown: South Korea Talks Directly with Taliban
The Taliban in Afghanistan have kidnapped 23 South Korean hostages and fixed sunset today as the deadline, demanding that South Korea withdraw its troops from Afghanistan or they would kill the hostages.
As the minutes and seconds go by, there have been positive developments in the situation.  South Korean officials held talks with the Taliban for the first time today.
But at the same time the Taliban said that another German hostage who had been kidnapped was in extremely poor health, and had started to become comatose and to lose consciousness.
The Taliban called on Germany and South Korea to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan and demanded 33 guerrillas imprisoned by the Afghan government in exchange for these hostages.
Taliban spokesperson Ahmadi said in a telephone interview by AFP at an undisclosed location: "We have established direct contact with the South Korean delegation through tribal elders."
Amadi said: "We hope this meeting will bring results."
The Taliban set dusk, local time (10:30 p.m. Taiwan time), as the deadline, and will start killing the South Korean hostages as soon as that time passes.
The guerrilla group has already extended the deadline twice.
Difficulty in Reaching Agreement in Dispute over Territorial Waters, Military Meeting Between the Two Koreas Breaks up in Discord
A three-day high-level military meeting between North and South Korea broke up in discord today, because both sides were immovable on the drawing of maritime borders.
The talks, held in the border city of Panmunjom, entered the final day of negotiation today.  North Korea's chief representative Lieutenant-General Kim Yong-Chol (transliterated) said: "We've come to the conclusion that we don't need these fruitless talks any more."
Red-faced and with an obviously displeased expression, Kim Yong-Chol criticized South Korea for intentionally avoiding discussions on drawing a new maritime border to replace the original "Northern Limit Line."
He alleged that the "Northern Limit Line" was not legal.
The "Northern Limit Line," located in the Yellow Sea, was set by the American military in 1953 after the end of the Korean war.  However, in recent years it has become a focus of dispute between the two Koreas, and North Korea has further refused to recognize it.
North Korea says that South Korean warships have illegally invaded these waters, causing tension.  South Korea calls this accusation groundless.
Conflict broke out in local waters in June, 1999, causing the deaths of dozens of North Korean sailors.
In June 2002 there was again news of a similar conflict.  Six South Koreans were unfortunately killed.
US Treasury Secretary Arrives on Visit to China; Environmental Protection and Exchange Rates are Focuses of Concern
US Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived yesterday on a visit to China.  The US is currently doing all it can to persuade China to carry out further necessary economic reforms and work on environmental protection.  The renminbi exchange rate is an issue that will receive particular attention.
US diplomats say that Paulson first visited Xining, capital city of China's large northwestern province of Qinghai.
China is currently carrying out a series of plans for environmental protection near the largest freshwater lake in Qinghai Province.
Today Paulson will move on to Beijing to discuss pushing for progress in the US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue started last year and other issues with Chinese chief officials.
The US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue mainly discusses economic, environmental protection and other issues.  Yet, the most important is the issue of the renminbi exchange rate.  US congressmen believe that the renminbi is excessively undervalued.
The trade deficit between the US and China is quickly escalating.  Internal pressure within the US is gradually rising, and congressmen are ready to take retributive action to resist what they call China's unfair trade policies.
Last week the US Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly approved a bill requiring the Treasury to identify a list of countries with "fundamentally misaligned" currency exchange rates.  This opens the door for potential economic sanctions to be brought against Beijing.
US congressmen say that the renminbi is undervalued, which makes the price of goods that China sells to the US extremely cheap, and adds to the trade imbalance between the US and China.  Last year the US's trade deficit with China reached 232.5 billion US dollars.
Mourinho Insists He Will Stay at Chelsea and Completely Retire from Soccer Before 60
Ever since the beginning of the season, Mourinho's future at Chelsea has been a hot topic in the media, but as before the Portuguese has again stressed that he will definitely be remaining in west London this summer.
"Some newspapers have listed 14 candidates to be the new manager of Chelsea, but I will stay at Chelsea," Mourinho joked.
Mourinho reiterated that he hoped one day to take up the reins of the Portugal team.  "I really want very much to train the national team, and I believe that one day the Portuguese Football Association will also hope very much to employ me to be the head coach of the national team."
However, the 44 year-old Mourinho does not intend to devote his entire life to soccer.  He said that he would retire before he was 60.  He doesn't want to work into his old age like Bobby Robson or Sir Ferguson.
"I have promised my wife that I won't keep coaching until I'm 70 like Robson and Ferguson."
Mourinho said frankly, "When I'm 60, I want to say farewell to soccer completely.
I have too many things waiting for me to do that I can't do at the moment."
"I don't want to become a soccer consultant or a technical supervisor, like Valdano or Sacchi.
I don't want to play this role.
I don't want to be a club chairman.  I just want to say farewell to soccer completely," Mourinho stressed.

"Illegal Brick Kiln" Trial Starts for Wang Bingbing of Caosheng Village, Hongdong, Shanxi (Picture)
Chinanews.com, July 4  The intermediate court of Linfen Municipality in Shanxi Province this morning began the first instance hearing in the "illegal brick kiln" case of Wang Bingbing of Caosheng Village, Guangshengsi Township, Hongdong County, Shanxi, amid great public interest.
Many domestic media outlets are following the progress of this case.
Because the local government departments involved are rather cautious, some reporters were not able to go in and do interviews at the scene.
The court trial is currently still in progress.
The staff at the Linfen intermediate criminal court revealed that if the trial goes smoothly, it could probably finish today.
But it is not yet known whether the judgment in this case will be announced at court.
At about nine o'clock in the morning, some reporters looked at the situation outside the front door of the Linfen intermediate court.  Passers-by were calm, and traffic was normal.
Perhaps they felt accustomed to the trial going on inside the court.
"When the time comes there'll be a verdict.  I believe the law is fair,"
a senior citizen said to himself as he passed by here and raised his head to look for a moment at the national emblem.
Previously, news from Hongdong County had confirmed that Wang Dongji, father of the defendant Wang Bingbing and former Party branch secretary of Caosheng Village, had been legally stripped of his status as a representative at the county People's Congress.
Previously, Wang Dongji had been removed from his position as secretary of the village Party branch with his Party membership revoked because of the issue of suspected breaches of discipline in the Wang Bingbing "illegal brick kiln" case.
The incident of slave labor in illegal brick kilns in Shanxi sparked by the Wang Bingbing illegal brick kiln case has attracted attention both at home and abroad.  High level central officials issued instructions demanding serious investigation.
North and South Korea Reach Agreement over Cooperation in Developing Light Industry and Exploiting Underground Resources
Chinanews.com, July 8
North Korea and South Korea reached an agreement on the 7th over cooperation in the areas of developing light industry and exploiting underground resources.
According to this agreement, South Korea will provide North Korea with the raw materials for the production of clothing and other light industrial products.  In return for this, North Korea will grant development rights for some mines in the country to South Korea.
According to reports from NHK, South Korea and North Korea held working-level talks at Kaesong over three days on issues in the areas of developing light industry and exploiting underground resources, and finally reached an agreement.
According to this agreement, South Korea will provide North Korea with raw materials for the production of clothes, shoes and soap within the year.  The total value will be equivalent to 9.8 billion Japanese yen.
In return for this, North Korea will grant development rights for three mines in the country to South Korea.
The South Korean government will use a cargo ship to send the first shipment of contracted materials - 500 tonnes of fiber - to North Korea from the western port of Incheon on July 25.
According to the plan, South Korea and North Korea will together start a survey of mines in the eastern part of North Korea from July 28.
At the end of last month, the South Korean government began a plan to provide 400,000 tonnes of rice as aid to North Korea.
Since North Korea signaled that it is willing to actively implement the closure of its nuclear facilities and other agreements reached in the six-party talks, economic cooperation between North and South Korea has revived.
Lanzhou Price Bureau Gives Explanation of Price Controls on Beef Noodles: It's Only Because the Rises have been Too Large
Chinanews.com, Lanzhou, July 10 (Huang Dang)
This afternoon, the Lanzhou municipal price bureau invited the departments concerned and held a seminar on the price controls on beef noodles.
This reporter learned at the meeting that the main reason that the price bureau and other departments of this city have jointly issued an upper price limit is that the rise in the price of beef noodles has been too large, and has gone beyond what most residents can cope with.
It is said that the rate of this rise in the price of beef noodles has reached 20%.  According to statistics, this is the largest rise in the shortest time since the first time the price of beef noodles rose in Lanzhou in the early 80s of the last century.
"Government actions must take ordinary local people's spending power into consideration.  The upper price limit we have issued is based on a survey of costs," said the head of the Lanzhou municipal price bureau.
On the 26th of last month four departments, including the Lanzhou municipal price bureau, industry and commerce administration, and health department, jointly imposed an upper price limit on the price of beef noodles in this city.  As soon as news was made public, it attracted intense attention.
It is understood that this seminar was aimed at listening to a wide range of opinions from all sectors, and seeking opinions and suggestions on issuing further specific measures.  It was also revealed that Lanzhou will hold a press conference tomorrow.
This will be the second press conference that Lanzhou Municipality has held on the incident of rises in the price of beef noodles.

Chinanews.com, July 11  According to the information on the website of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Civil Affairs on July 9 imposed administrative punitive measures requiring a three-month suspension of activities on the China Council for the Promotion of Area Development.
The penalty order shows that the China Council for the Promotion of Area Development committed the following illegal activities: 1) collecting membership fees higher than the standards; 2) using membership fee receipts to collect other fees from non-member organizations.

Apart from collecting the membership fees of 2,000 yuan from one member organization, it collected from each of the other organizations the membership fees ranging from 10,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan.  This made a total of over 800,000 yuan, including management and other fees collected from branch organizations and internal organizations.  This seriously contravened the relevant laws.
The Ministry of Civil Affairs -- the Ministry of Civil Affairs imposed administrative punitive measures requiring a three-month suspension of activities on the council in accordance with the regulations in item (8), article 1, clause 33 of "Regulations on the Registration and Administration of Social Organizations," and locked away the seal and other relevant items of the council in accordance with the law.

Wang Yan's Injury Condition Improves as She "Maintains" Seated Posture on Bench and Her Arm Strength Recovers by "Two Points"
"Wang Yan can now sit up on a bench, but still not for too long, otherwise she feels dizzy," Zhejiang Sports Bureau gymnastics center director Wu Xiqin told reporters yesterday.
Prior to this, the condition of Wang Yan, who was injured in competition, had been steadily improving.  The recovery of strength in her left and right arms had improved by "two points" compared to over ten days before.
On the 4th of this month, when Wang Yan was transferred from the ICU (intensive care unit) of Shanghai's No. 6 Hospital to a special-needs ward, the strength in her right arm was 2-3 points, and the strength in her left arm was 1 point.
After nearly half a month, the strength in Wang Yan's arms has further improved.
"The doctors say that the strength in Wang Yan's right arm has reached more than 4, just one point lower than the normal score of 5.  The strength in her left arm is also over 3," said Wu Xiqin.
That is to say, in less than half a month's time, Wang Yan's arm strength has recovered by "two points."
A while before, with the help of doctors, Wang Yan was able to remain sitting in bed for five minutes.
The hospital's rehabilitation specialist had originally planned to have Wang Yan start doing touch down exercises within the protection of a rehabilitation bed at the end of last week.
But given Wang Yan's recovery at the present stage, the floor rehabilitation exercises had to be postponed for the time being.
Wu Xiqin said that Wang Yan's current exercises mainly focused on "sitting."  "She can maintain a seated posture on a bench for a while, but still not for too long."  (Correspondent Wang Chunqiu)
Venezuelan President Chavez Says He Will Make Major Cuts in the Salaries of High-level Civil Servants
Chinanews.com, July 23, Comprehensive Report  Venezuelan President Chavez made a long speech on the 22nd on Venezuela's internal affairs and foreign policy.
He said there will be major cuts in the salaries of high-level civil servants.
He also said that if any foreigners who came to Venezuela attacked the Venezuelan government, they would face severe consequences and would be deported.
Chavez has already ordered government officials to closely monitor the speech of foreigners when they visit Venezuela.  If anyone is found publicly criticizing him or the Venezuelan government, they should be all deported.
In his televised speech on the evening of the 22nd, he said that Venezuela could not tolerate "foreigners coming into our home and making wild accusations."
He also said in his speech that there will be major cuts in the salaries of high-level civil servants.
He said the highest salary for a civil servant in Venezuela must not exceed 7,000 US dollars per month.
It is learned that in Venezuela, the monthly income of some poor people is 250 US dollars.
Cutting the salaries of civil servants has become a trend in Latin American countries and has gained widespread approval among the public.
The leaders of Peru, Bolivia and other countries have all cut their own pay.
Chavez also said that Cuban leader Castro had reminded him to watch out for assassination commanded by the US.
He said that Castro had presented him with a memoir written by Tenet, a former head of the US Central Intelligence Agency, and asked him to have a look at various CIA's "secrets that cannot be told to anyone."
F1 "Spy Case" Hearing Finished Yesterday; McLaren Escapes Penalties for Now
Last night Beijing time, the special hearing held by the FIA World Motor Sports Council in Paris over the Ferrari engineer spy case came to a close.  McLaren, who had been summoned, managed a lucky escape: the council decided not to impose any penalty on McLaren for the time being.
The FIA official website published a statement after the hearing, saying: "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes was in possession of confidential Ferrari information, but at present there is insufficient evidence to show that this information was used improperly in the FIA Formula One World Championship.  Therefore no penalty will be imposed."
However, this does not definitively close the Ferrari engineer spy case.
The Motor Sports Council also said in this decision: "If it is found in the future that the information relating to Ferrari has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to request McLaren to return to WMSC for a hearing.  At that time, they may face the penalty of the cancellation of their qualification to take part in the 2007 championship and even the 2008 championship."
Mike Coughlan, the former chief designer for McLaren who has now been suspended from his job, has been found to have been in possession of nearly 800 pages of Ferrari's technical documents.  The contents included sets of details of the design, power, construction, checks, tests, development and operation of Ferrari's 2007 race car.
McLaren insists that no-one else in the team knew about this information before Coughlan was suspended from his job, and that the McLaren car for this season has no elements from Ferrari.

Experts Think Insurance QDIIs Will Not Divert Funds away from Domestic Stock Market in the Short Term
Chinanews.com, July 30
According to a report in China Securities Journal, the Provisional Measure for the Overseas Investment with Insurance Funds was recently published, and insurance funding has greater room for operation in the capital markets.
China Life Insurance Company's chief investment officer Liu Lefei thinks that with the renminbi appreciation and the domestic capital markets improving, insurance institutions will not make large investments overseas through foreign currency purchases in the short term.  This also means that insurance QDIIs will not divert funds away from the domestic stock market in the short term.
The report says that quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view.
Experts say that because there is currently no renminbi derivatives market as yet, and the risk-avoidance techniques of insurance institutions are not sufficient, the time is not yet ripe for large-scale foreign currency purchases.
Liu Lefei says that in the long term, in terms of asset allocation, overseas investment should occupy a certain proportion of an insurance company's overall allocation.
However, given the fairly large upwards pressure on the renminbi at present, China Life would mainly be using its own funds in foreign currencies for making overseas investment.
In the current situation it should take a cautious attitude toward purchasing foreign currencies to invest overseas.

Bian Implies Criticism of Judiciary Getting Involved in Elections; Taiwan's "Judicial Yuan" Denies It and Demands His Explaination
Chinanews.com, July 31  On the 30th Chen Shui-bian questioned that members of the judiciary on the island may have tried to get involved in elections for leaders in the Taiwan region.
Kao Chin-chih, director-general of Taiwan's "Department of Judicial Administration," said on the same day that the current behavior of judges on the island was not as Chen Shui-bian said, and demanded that Chen Shui-bian give an explanation of his comments.
According to reports in Taiwan's United Daily, Chen Shui-bian questioned on the 30th that for political reasons or electoral considerations, judges, prosecutors or investigators may be interfering with, affecting or even trying to control the campaign activities of candidates from all parties.  He said he hoped that this kind of phenomenon did not exist in Taiwan, but that it was perhaps extremely difficult.
Weng Yueh-sheng, "president of the Judicial Yuan" in Taiwan, kept quiet and made no response to Chen Shui-bian's questions, but "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun sent Kao Chin-chih to make a statement on behalf of the "Judicial Yuan."
Kao Chin-chih said that Taiwan's basic law and the "regulations for judges" both explicitly state that judges should be above party factions, must not take part in political party activities, and must not campaign, either.  Judges were all extremely prudent and respected these relevant restrictions, and the "Judicial Yuan" believed that judges all acquit themselves admirably.
Kao Chin-chih gave an example, saying that "High Court Kaohsiung Branch Court" judge Chang Sheng-hsi took part in a class at the Ketagalan Institute a few years ago, the self-regulation council organized by judges decided to punish him because the relevant syllabus had political party implications.
Once Chang Sheng-hsi wanted to take part in the DPP primaries, but because of controversy over retaining his position and taking part in the election, he decided in the end to give up on it.
Kao Chin-chih believes that if it's specific judgments in cases, there is relief available at the court level, and one should not infer that judges have political intentions simply based on wins or losses in the verdicts.
Germany Plans to Lower Threshold for Bringing in Professionals
Staff Writer, Berlin, July 1 (Correspondent Wang Huaicheng)
German Federal Minister of Education and Research Schavan said recently that Germany should lower the qualifying conditions for bringing in foreign professionals in the Immigration Law and solve the problem of the shortage of professionals that Germany is facing through increasing the recruitment of foreign talents.
According to a report by OECD, by 2010 the number of workers between age 15 and 64 in Germany will be gradually decreasing each year.
If there are not enough immigrants, the labor force in Germany in 2020 will decrease by 6% as compared with the present.
However, reports by organizations such as the German Employers Association and the German Association of Engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage of engineers and professionals in the current job market in Germany.
According to the statistics from Germany's Federal Labor Department, this May, the supply of engineers in the labor market in Germany had a shortfall of about 12,700 people and the supply of technicians had a shortfall of about 9,600 people.
In order to protect native employment, Germany has set a relatively high threshold for bringing in foreign talents.
Germany's Immigration Law stipulates that professionals from non-EU countries should have annual salaries of no less than 85,500 euros in Germany, otherwise they cannot get the permit to work and live in Germany.
Schavan suggests that this qualifying amount be reduced to 40,000 to 60,000 euros.
Don't Blindly Worship Legal "Theory Circle"
It is stipulated in Article 8 of the draft amendment of the Lawyers Law which has been recently submitted to the NPC standing committee for review that people who were once engaged in the profession of researching and teaching laws and have obtained advanced professional titles or equivalent professional levels may be granted the permission to practice law when their applications for lawyers' licenses pass the review by the judicial administrative department of the State Council.
(June 28, the China Youth Daily)
In the legal community there is a distinction between the "theory circle" and the "practice circle."  The former mainly includes the "abstract activities" such as teaching and researching laws, while the latter is more engaged in the "concrete activities" such as litigation, legal counseling, and legal services.
For a long time there has existed a phenomenon of "scholars' mutual contempt" between the legal "theory circle" and the "practice circle."  The "theory circle" believes that the "practice circle" lacks the necessary legal training and consists only of mechanical "legalists," while the "practice circle" criticizes the "theory circle" by pointing out that "theory cannot direct practice."
With regard to such a labor division, what the law can do is to maintain neutrality rather than vigorously support either party.
However, the "system of specially licensed lawyers" in the Lawyers Law acknowledges in reality the judgment that the legal "theory circle" is superior to the legal "practice circle."
In fact, some experts and scholars who have been engaged in the research and teaching of pure legal theories such as the history of the legal system and the international laws have nothing to do with practicing law no matter how profound their theoretical achievements have been.
Thus, the "system of specially licensed lawyers" has doubtlessly opened up a "bad loophole" for confusing qualification in the legal "practice circle" which will have an extremely negative impact.
There is also more blind worship of the "theory circle" than these.  For example, the phenomenon that expert opinions and expert panels frequently influence and even negate court rulings is also a direct manifestation of such blind worship.
Chinese-owned Vessels Encouraged to Sail under Five-Star Red Flag
Staff Writer, Correspondent Feng Lei
It was learned at the press conference held by the State Council Information Office that starting from July 1 this year, China will implement the Ad hoc Tax-free Registration Policy for Chinese-owned International Shipping Vessels to encourage Chinese-owned vessels flying foreign flags to register back in the country so as to acquire the nationality of the People's Republic of China and sail under the five-star red flag.
In order to further promote the healthy growth of the maritime shipping industry in our country and expand the national fleet and address the relevant problems arising from a considerable number of our country's vessels engaged in international shipping registering overseas and operating under foreign flags, the Ministry of Communications has recently issued "The Public Notice Regarding the Implementation of the Ad hoc Tax-free Registration Policy for Chinese-owned International Shipping Vessels," clarifying the conditions for enjoying the ad hoc tax-free policy and the application procedures.  Starting from July 1 this year, eligible vessels which submit import declarations within two years shall be exempt from customs duties and import VAT.
Applicant vessels may choose Shanghai, Tianjin, or Dalian as their ports of nationality to process vessel registration.
Britain Lowers Terrorist Attack Alert Level
Staff Writer, London, July 5 (Correspondent Guo Lin)
On the 4th, the British government lowered the terrorist attack alert level from the highest level to the "severe" level.  This shows that terrorist attacks in Britain will not be imminent, but attacks are still "highly likely."
At present, the British police has shifted its scope of investigation to India and Australia.
Since the eight terrorist attack suspects that have been arrested had all worked in the medical system, the government will conduct an emergency investigation of the backgrounds of foreign immigrants who have been employed in the medical system.
It was learned that nearly 90,000 people employed in the British public medical system have all obtained their qualification for practicing medicine from abroad.
In addition Prime Minister Brown required that background checks be conducted for high-tech immigration applicants and that employers or relevant agencies shall be required to provide applicants' background data.
Keep Public Places from Harassment of Peddlers
When people go out traveling, they are looking for relaxation, freshness, and freedom, enjoying as much as possible the natural scenery and achievements of civilized society.
However, while traveling in the country, many people have experienced such nuisance as being besieged and cornered by peddlers and middlemen in public places.
Whether you are getting on or off a bus or train, you invariably suffer the harassment of peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen.
They either sell chicken eggs, peanuts, or sesame seed cakes, or newspapers and magazines.  In addition, many unlicensed middlemen make referrals to restaurants and lodgings, even hawking fake certificates, fake receipts, and so on.
If you don't take them, he can chase you for several hundreds of meters as if he would rather die than fail.
In some scenic spots, many tourists also have the same experience.
Before you enter the main gate, someone would come to hawk things like tourist souvenirs and small pieces of arts and crafts.
There are more scenarios of this kind after you go through the gate, which completely ruins even your best mood.
Some media once reported that many foreign tourists coming to Xi'an praised endlessly the places of historic interest and scenic beauty in Xi'an, but felt it was incomprehensible that crowds of peddlers are allowed to hawk their wares everywhere.
Such public places including bus stations and scenic spots are places meant for traveling and recreation.  Attention should be paid to civility and orderliness as well as tranquility and harmony, providing tourists a comfortable and relaxing environment.
The unrestricted entry and exit of peddlers not only disturb the mood of tourists, but also actually destroy the public order of these public places, giving rise to the visual contamination and environmental contamination, while providing the conditions and opportunities for lawless people to make trouble.
The important thing is that these public places are the windows of spiritual civilization construction in the local areas.  A small glimpse can reveal a larger picture.  Not only the image is being damaged but the growth of local economy will also be impacted.
Just imagine, if you want to expand and strengthen the tourism industry but welcome guests traveling from all directions with such a messy tourist environment, who will still want to come, and who still dare to come?
Then how can your tourist economy gain returns?
As the tourist high season approaches, creating a civilized tourist environment for tourists coming from all directions should be considered the top priority.
Public places are not markets.  The operation by peddlers should be regulated.  Unlicensed operation must be resolutely banned, and there should be relentless crackdown on illegal activities.
Only a civilized and orderly environment can get tourists to come happily, who will leave after fully enjoying themselves and keep the passion for a return trip.
In a word, keep public places from the harassment of peddlers.
"Rewarding Voluntary Withdrawal from Welfare System" Does Not Hold Water
The Jianguomen Neighborhood in Dongcheng District of Beijing gave away things like refrigerators as rewards to twelve households that voluntarily withdrew from the welfare system.
(The Beijing News, July 10)
While feeling happy for these families for the improvement of their lives, this writer is ambivalent toward the proposal of "voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system" and the "reward-giving" method.
The deputy director of the Jianguomen Neighborhood office said, "In response to the issue of the welfare fraud, encouraging voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system aims to set a good example for other households on welfare."
If it is to encourage other welfare recipients to get out of their difficult situations through their own efforts, then this example is indeed worth promoting.  If this is intended to "appeal" to those longtime cheaters of the welfare system, then it may be a bit naive.
Working to distinguish between real and fake welfare recipients and sort them out, we should rely more on the law.
The relevant department should stress the obligations that welfare recipients must carry out while enjoying the welfare: for example, promptly notifying the changes in the family members and incomes, reporting the status of employment, accepting regular reviews, etc.  On the other hand, the relevant department should step up monitoring and inspection.
After all, only "withdrawing from the welfare system according to the law" is the long-term strategy.
Who will foot the bill for the material rewards given by the neighborhood to the households that withdrew from the welfare system?
As a level-one government organization, the neighborhood's expenses are covered by the funding from the government budget.
However, is it legitimate to spend this sum of tax payers' money?
On the one hand, households that have withdrawn from the welfare system prove that they have attained certain abilities to be "self-sufficient;" on the other hand, aren't there still people who apply for the welfare?
The funding from the government budget which is called "life-saving" money should be used to provide timely help instead of extra bonus.
Liu Gangyi's Remark about His Willingness to Be a Service Provider Is More Believable
On July 10, Liu Gangyi, the party committee secretary of Mulan Township, Xindu District, Chengdu City, who is the first township party committee secretary through public nomination and direct election in the whole country, received his fourth democratic evaluation since he took office.  The rate of satisfaction reached 97%.
During his conversation with reporters, Liu Gangyi defined himself as a "service provider."
(Yesterday, The Beijing News)
The "service provider" as spoken by Liu Gangyi is probably more truthful and more believable than the "service provider" as spoken by some appointed cadres.
The greatest advantage of public nomination and direct election as compared with the system of appointment lies in the fact that in the former the source of power is mainly determined by ordinary party members and the masses, while in the latter it is mainly appointed by upper-level organizations.  And where the power originates determines that the former must take its  responsibility to the general public as top priority.
The source of power and to whom they should answer are the basic factors that determine how the elected will go about their work.
Some people suspect that this kind of "democratic evaluation" is more like a "democracy show."
My opinion is that it is better to have this form of "democratic evaluation" than nothing at all.
Considering the history and current status of China's grassroots democratic and political construction, I think that it is already a major breakthrough to have public nomination and direction election.  Being a major component of this innovation, the democratic evaluation is not to be underestimated in promoting the grassroots democratic and political construction.
First Woman President Expected to Be Elected in India; Analysts Call Her Election Quite Likely; Female Voters Hope She Can Raise the Status of Women
On June 23, Patil brought her hands together palm to palm before she filled the presidential candidate documents.
India's presidential election kicked off on the 19th.  The new president will be chosen between the current vice president Shekhawat and Pratibha Patil, who recently resigned as governor of Rajasthan.
Patil is the first woman presidential candidate in the history of India.  If she is elected, she will become the first woman president ever in the Indian history.
Patil is the presidential candidate for the ruling party INC, while Shekhawat is from the opposition party BJP.
Since the INC occupies a dominant position in the presidential electoral college, the media and the general public all speculate that Patil is rather likely to be elected.
Patil, currently 72 years old, was a woman governor of Rajasthan.
She was born into a lawyer's family and entered the parliament in 1985.  With rich experiences in politics, she was well acclaimed by the government during her tenure as governor of Rajasthan.
In addition she is devoted to the social welfare and is the honorary chairperson of many cultural, educational, and social welfare organizations.
Analysts pointed out that the reason why Patil became a candidate is because she has remained loyal to the INC president Sonia Gandhi.
In India the Gandhi family has controlled the ruling INC party for a long time.
Patil is supported and respected by a large number of female voters.  Female voters believe that Patil will reshape the image of women and raise the status of women in India, where discrimination against females is a dominant ideology.
The constitution stipulates that India is a federal-system country .  The president is the nominal head of state and commander of the armed forces, representing no party organization and serving more as a symbol.

US Supports Pakistani Government in Ousting Extremists
Staff Writer, Washington, July 22 (Correspondent Xu Qisheng)
US President Bush said on the 21st that the US will fully support the Pakistani government in driving al Qaeda and Taliban extremists out of the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
In his regular weekly radio address that day, Bush said that according to the latest US intelligence, al Qaeda has found a "safe haven" in the area of Pakistan bordering Afghanistan.
He expressed "serious concern" over this.
Bush said that the US will continue to support Pakistani President Musharraf, believing that Musharraf will persistently fight against al Qaeda and Taliban militants.
It is noted in the National Intelligence Estimate report recently released by the US that Islamic militant organizations, Bin Laden's al Qaeda in particular, still constitute a persistent threat to the US.
The agreement reached by Musharraf and some tribal leaders in the northern region of Pakistan last September on guarding against the remnant forces of the Taliban and activities of al Qaeda members has failed to achieve the expected result.
These tribal leaders "were unwilling or unable" to maintain the security of the region on their own.
In this prerecorded address, Bush said that Musharraf is taking active steps to correct this mistake.
US Hopes for Full Enforcement of Agreement on North Korea Nuclear Issue
Staff Writer, Washington, July 24 (Correspondent Xu Qisheng)
Hill, US assistant secretary of state and US chief representative to the six-party talks on the North Korea nuclear issue, said on the 23rd that the six-party talks on the North Korea nuclear issue held last week is very important.  For the first time the meeting achieved real progress, but this is only the "initial action" in implementing the agreement.
The US hopes very much that the September 19 Joint Statement and the February 13 Joint Document regarding the resolution of the North Korea nuclear issue can be fully implemented in 2008.
At the press conference held that day, Hill said that in order to achieve the goal of completely resolving the North Korea nuclear issue in 2008, it is necessary that North Korea declare its entire nuclear program and disable its nuclear facilities by the end of this year.
He hopes that all relevant parties can fully implement the agreement reached at the six-party talks on the North Korea nuclear issue within a year.
In addition Hill said that while holding talks on security and energy resources issues, the US-North Korea and Japan-North Korea working groups will also respectively discuss the outstanding issues in the bilateral relations between the US and North Korea as well as Japan and North Korea.
Climate Change Leads to Rapid Shrinking of Alps Glacier
Staff Writer, Geneva, July 29 (Correspondent Liu Jun)
A long-term follow-up research by glacier experts at the Swiss Academy of Sciences found that from 1850 to 2005 the 1,800 plus glaciers in Switzerland were shrinking at an annual rate of 3%.
The heat wave in 2003 alone caused the Alps glacier to melt by 1.8%
Experts believe that if the global temperature rises by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100, the glaciers will have shrunk by 80% compared with the present and that with a temperature rise of 5 degrees Celsius, the glaciers will have entirely melted.
The Aletsch glacier is the longest glacier in Europe and has been inscribed on the list of the UNESCO Natural World Heritage.  However, from 2005 to 2006, it shrank by 100 meters within a year.  There can be no more delay in protecting the natural environment.

Toll of Eternal Warning Bell "Links up" with Hong Kong as the World Jointly Celebrates Ten Years of Reversion
On July 1, the Eternal Warning Bell in the Memorial Hall of Nanjing's Jinghai Temple was tolled once again, the sound of the bell ringing melodiously.
This rich echo of history connected the mainland and Hong Kong via television, as the citizens of Nanjing and Hong Kong compatriots "shared the same occasion from the far corners of the earth" and celebrated together the tenth anniversary of Hong Kong's reversion to the motherland.
Ten years previously, at 12:00 a.m. on July 1, the sound of the tolling of the Eternal Warning Bell reverberated 155 times in the sky over the bell tower of the Memorial Hall of Nanjing's Jinghai Temple, bidding farewell to the humiliating history of the cession of Hong Kong island.
People from all walks of life in Nanjing society gathered together in front of the gate of the smallish Memorial Hall.  They said that they wanted to give an eternal warning to themselves and to later generations not to forget history by ringing this Eternal Warning Bell with their own two hands.
"The bell of the Eternal Warning Bell is 1.842 meters high, and the year 1842 was precisely when the 'Nanjing Treaty' was concluded at the time of the eruption of the Opium War.
The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters high, and 1997 was the year of Hong Kong's reversion."
The man behind the devising and casting of the Eternal Warning Bell that year, Wang Fengling, explained that "there are five 'wan' character inscriptions around the body of the bell.  The whole copper bell is in high relief, with two dragons supporting a fireball, symbolizing the fact that Hong Kong is the motherland's 'Pearl of the Orient.'  Finally, Nanjing's city flower, the plum blossom, forms the pattern on the body of the bell where the bell is struck."
Yu Xiaodong, a member of the Democratic Party and the first person back then to propose the construction of the Eternal Warning Bell sighed with emotion, saying, "Before we knew it, it has been ten years already since the reversion of Hong Kong."  He hopes that Hong Kong's tomorrow could be like the sound of that tolling bell, "resounding and melodious, ongoing and everlasting."

Russia's Security Service Accuses Exiled Oligarch Berezovsky of "Plotting to Launch a Coup d'Etat"
A lawyer for Berezovsky, the Russian oligarch in exile in London, Borovkov, announced on July 2 that the Russian Federal Security Service had formally issued a new charge against his client, accusing Berezovsky of "plotting to engineer a coup d'état and attempting a violent seizure of political power in Russia."
Borovkov pointed out that in April this year Berezovsky had announced during an interview with a journalist from the British "Guardian" newspaper that he was preparing to launch a "palace coup" in Russia, and confirmed that he was providing financial support to representatives of the right-wing elite opposed to the policies of the administration.
The Russian Federal Security Service's investigation bureau immediately launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky under article 278 on "forcible seizure of power" of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation, and has formally brought forward related charges in Moscow's Savyolovsky court recently.
It is reported that the Russian Procuratorate-General brought criminal charges against Berezovsky in February 2006, similarly based on the exiled oligarch's confirmation during an interview that he was attempting a seizure of state power by force in Russia.
As Berezovsky has remained in exile abroad, making it impossible to extradite him, Russia authorities temporarily suspended the investigation of the case in January 2007.
On July 2, Moscow's Savyolovsky court began to hear another criminal case against the exiled oligarch.  The Russian Procuratorate-General accused Berezovsky of embezzling funds of 214 million roubles from Aeroflot and laundering 16 million roubles.  After the hearing the court decided to postpone judicial investigation into this case till July 12, and a state defense lawyer will be assigned for the defendant in this period.
Berezovsky believes that this is all a "farce," and has explicitly prohibited his defense lawyer from taking part in the court hearings.

The autonomous region's electronic system for the inspection of administrative efficiency is directly connected to 33 key approval departments directly under the autonomous region and 135 responsible posts that deal with the investment environment and the production and life of the masses,  further standardizing their approval behavior and raising their approval efficiency.
At the same time, all levels of Guangxi's discipline inspection supervision bodies are solemnly investigating cases that touch on the efficiency of workstyles or harm the interests of the people.  So far, they have investigated and verified 1,104 cases and concluded 769 cases, and held to account 584 work units and 619 individuals.
The secretary of the standing committee of Guangxi Autonomous Region's party committee and discipline inspection committee, Ma Tieshan, said on the 5th that inspection of administrative efficiency is a task that will accompany administrative activities from beginning to end, and it was necessary to gradually put in place a long-term and effective mechanism.
Guangxi is to further perfect and standardize all of its administrative management regulations and systems, and set up and perfect an administrative efficiency inspection work mechanism and safeguard system, so as to put efficiency inspection on an institutionalized  and standardized track; further standandize supervision and inspection procedures, strengthen and improve the complaint resolution mechanism and performance evaluation and assessment mechanism; step up accountability, and use a strict accountability system to ensure the practical implementation of the "ask first" responsibility system, the time-limited case-handling system, and other work systems.

Two Jordanese Sentenced for Plotting an Attack on Americans
Two Jordanese men were sentenced by the Jordanian State Security Court on the 11th for plotting to attack Americans in Jordan.
Of the two men, both aged 25, one called Sameeh al-Hotari was sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment with forced labor, and the other called Mohammed Shehada was sentenced to three years' imprisonment with forced labor.
A court official said that al-Hotari was also charged with illegal possession of firearms, and that the police had found an assault rifle while searching his place of residence.
The court originally decided to sentence al-Hotari to life imprisonment, but later considered giving him an opportunity to "turn over a new leaf," and reduced the sentence to 8 years.
According to the indictment, after the outbreak of the Iraq war the two accused decided to avenge the Muslims who were "being bullied by the Americans," and plotted to attack Americans living in Jordan.
In August 2006 they selected as a target an American living in a suburb of the Jordanian capital, Amman, but were arrested by the police before carrying out an attack on him.
The identity of this American was not made public in the indictment.
The indictment also charged the two defendants with planning to attack other Americans, but no concrete details were divulged.

Number of Reports of Adverse Reactions Caused by Diabetic Medicine, Avandia, Increases Sharply
According to a report in the US media on the 15th, there has recently been a trend in the US towards a sharp increase in the number of reports of heart diseases and other adverse reactions caused by Avandia, an anti-diabetic medicine.
In May this year the US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning, recommending that sufferers from diabetes exercise caution when using Avandia, because a scientist had published a research report in the edition of the New England Journal of Medicine that came out on May 21, saying that this best-selling drug could greatly increase the incidence of and death rate from heart disease among sufferers.
Consequently, the safety of Avandia has received close attention by doctors and patients.
Statistics show that in the approximately one month following the issuing of the safety warning, the US FDA had received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, of which 38 were reports of deaths.
And yet the FDA had received just 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions in January and February this year respectively.
These adverse reactions ranged from being as trivial as getting blisters to as serious as sudden deaths from heart disease.
However, the US FDA's pharmaceuticals experts believe that it would currently be premature to reach the conclusion that Avandia is not safe.
The FDA will hold a hearing into the safety of Avandia on July 30.
Avandia, which came on the market in 1999, is an insulin sensitizer, suitable for treating Type 2 diabetes.
Some 6 million diabetes sufferers worldwide have taken or are taking Avandia.
Avandia's producer, the British company GlaxoSmithKline, continues to believe that Avandia is safe, and that for suffers "the benefits outweigh the drawbacks."
US Wishes to Restart Middle East Peace Talks
US President Bush gave an address on the 16th in Washington, calling for the holding of an international conference on the Palestine-Israel issue this fall, and inviting Israel, Palestine and some of the surrounding Arab countries and other countries concerned to take part, in order to jointly push for the restarting of the Middle East peace process.
On the 17th, Bush also made separate phone calls to Egypt's President Mubarak, Jordan's King Abdullah II, and Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, asking them to respond positively to this proposal, give practical support to Abbas, the president of the Palestinian National Authority, and help the Palestinians and the Israelis to resume peace talks at an early date.
Abbas Says the PLO Central Committee Will Discuss the Issue of Bringing Forward the Palestinian General Election
The president of the Palestinian National Authority, Abbas, said in Ramallah on the 18th that the two-day conference of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Central Committee had been inaugurated on the same day, and that the conference would discuss bringing forward the holding of elections for the Palestinian National Authority and the Legislative Council and other issues.
On the same day Abbas met the EU High Representative for foreign and security affairs, Solana, in the Ramallah Presidential Office, and said at the subsequent joint press conference that if the PLO Central Committee made the relevant resolutions, the president would have the power to issue a "legal, effective" decree, and a decree of this type would be issued quickly.
At the same time, Abbas felt satisfied with relations between the Palestinian National Authority and the EU.
He said that Palestine welcomed the EU's understanding of measures adopted by the Palestinian Presidential Office.
Abbas urged the EU to continue providing humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people in Gaza.
Solana reaffirmed the EU's support for Abbas as well as the Palestinian people.
He said the four sides involved in the Middle East issue (the UN, the EU, the US and Russia) would convene a conference on the 19th to discuss the issue of restarting the Middle East peace process, and a proposal would probably be put forward in the next few days.
Solana said the EU maintained a positive attitude towards the deployment of international troops in Gaza, but still needed to discuss this with various other parties.  In particular, discussions will need to be held with the UN.

US Department of Defense Reconsiders Plans to Reduce US Troops in Europe
An official in the US Department of Defense said on the 23rd that due to the Iraq war and changes in the world situation, the US Department of Defense is reconsidering a plan drawn up in 2002 to cut the number of US troops in Europe by approximately half.
The US media cited a Department of Defense official as saying that due to the ongoing Iraq war and the worsening US relations with Russia and Iran, Department of Defense leaders have raised doubts about the feasibility of plans to cut troops in Europe.
In 2002 the then Secretary of Defense Rumsfield announced that the US would reduce troop numbers in Europe from the original 113,000 to 71,000 before 2012, in order to create a new-style army with "fewer, but better" soldiers.
The US army's total forces in Europe have currently fallen to 100,000 people.
But in June this year, Commander Craddock of the US Army Headquarters in Europe submitted a report to the current secretary of defense, Gates, raising doubts over the above-mentioned reduction plan.
The report said that while US army forces are being reduced in Europe, many military units would be deployed on a rotation basis to Iraq and Afghanistan for combat, leading to a shortfall in US troops in Europe to such an extent that there would be no way to develop normal cooperation with European allies.
The report recommended halting the plan to reduce US troops in Europe.
Relevant US experts believe that the above-mentioned phenomenon shows that the prolonged and unresolved Iraq war has disrupted the original US military's restructuring plans.

Three Main Functions of Modern Military Uniform
The first is the identification function.
It is an important sign that distinguishes the armies of different countries, different military services, and between the military and civilians.
In the armies of more than 100 large and small countries of the world, although the use of military uniform is basically identical, there are no two countries' armies whose military uniforms are completely the same.
The second is the symbolic function.
To a certain extent, military uniform is both a reflection of a country's mental outlook and its national characteristics, and is also a concentrated embodiment of a country's military ability to wage war and the quality of its servicemen.
In the three main types of military uniform -- ceremonial attire, everyday uniforms, and drill uniforms -- the one that can express national prestige and military prestige to the fullest extent is none other than ceremonial attire that is well-pressed and pleasing to the eye.
The third is the protective function.
With the rapid development of high-tech and updated weaponry, improving the overall protective capacity of new-style drill uniforms to give military uniform various types of functions -- including bulletproofing, stealth protection, anti-chemical, anti-bacterial and anti-radiation functions, as well as control of the temperature, humidity and the air -- has become a key issue in the development of military uniform.

A Brigade Party Committee Organ Has the Courage to Handle Thorny Issues Properly
Staff Writer, Chengdu, July 3
Report by Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu: "We can now move into apartments as a result of the brigade party committee organ's resolution and boldness in freeing up the apartments."
Today, more than ten cadres in a communications drill brigade in Chengdu Military Command were all beaming with pleasure as they moved into apartments.  They felt full of admiration and gratitude for the way the "group" on the brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles in solving thorny issues.
Over the past few years, along with the replacement of personnel, an excessive part of the brigade's accommodation for family members had been occupied against regulations, making it difficult to house the cadres on active duty.  Officers and men had quite strong views about this.
The brigade had tried to free up the apartments several times, but failed to get it done each time due to all kinds of obstruction, allowing the problem to become a long-standing, big and difficult issue.
"As long as we have the courage to do things properly and are fair and reasonable, there are no difficulties we cannot solve."
After the group on the new party committee had reached a consensus, the principal leaders appeared in person and set about thoroughly sorting out all the problems relating to occupation of apartments against regulations.
On the one hand they appealed to people's emotions and explained their reasoning, hoping that the personnel concerned would consider the whole picture; on the other hand, they explained the policies and regulations relating to military apartments, apartments built with pooled money, and economical and adequate apartments, to show the party committee's staunch determination and principled stance.
In the case of personnel who had accommodation elsewhere and were not willing to leave the additional apartments they occupied, the party committee organ promptly made contact with the work units they were in and adopted relevant measures to encourage them to take the initiative in cooperating with the work of the army.
Over two months of meticulous work, all residents occupying additional apartments in the army barracks against regulations had all moved out on schedule, and cadres who worked in the brigade were all assigned the accommodation in accordance with regulations.
The way in which this brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles has also given rise to a chain reaction.  Several cadres who originally were unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization's allotment have now one by one also expressed their willingness to obey the organization's decisions.

07-Series Military Uniform Designers Visit China Military Online
Staff Writer,  Beijing, July 13  Report by Yang Baojin and Correspondent Liu Xinxin: The whole of the army will change into 07-series military uniforms in succession from August 1.
This evening, China Military Online has specially invited Chen Jun, the deputy director of the Clothing and Equipment Office of the Military Supplies and Fuel Division of the General Logistics Department, and Su Yang, senior engineer in the Military Supplies Equipment Research Office of the General Logistics Department and one of the designers of the 07-series military uniforms, to be its guests at China Military Online, and engage in free discussions with netizens both in and outside the army on the background to the development of the new military uniforms and the manufacturing process, provoking a response from the netizens.
The two honored guests directly took part in the design and manufacture of the 07-series military uniforms.
While discussing the changes in the new uniforms, they explained that the 07-series uniforms were designed on the basis of previous uniform changes, in particular, the 97-series uniforms, and had made improvements in seven areas, including the uniform series, standards, and styles, totaling hundreds of items.
The greatest feature of the 07-series uniforms is that it has reflected the requirements for serialization, functionalization and personalization, allowing our army's military uniform to achieve standards in terms of coordination among the three armed services, completeness of varieties and the way the series forms a set for the first time.  This signifies the realization of a historical leap in the level of our army's military uniform development.

This interview was jointly sponsored by China Military Online and china.org.cn, sina.com.cn and TOM.com.
People's Armed Force Department in Jingjiang City Sets up a Platform to Raise the Quality of Their Full-time Cadres
Staff Writer, Report by Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin: On June 18, at a training class for People's Armed Force full-time cadres in Jingjiang city in Jiangsu province, Lu Yuqing, leader of the People's Armed force department of Xilai township, delivered a training lecture "Winning a Psychological War under Informationalized Conditions" that received a unanimous favorable assessment from the trainees.
This was a new change that was brought about by the city's People's Armed Force when it has put more pressure on its cadres based on the reality of their positions in an effort to raise People's Armed Force cadres' comprehensive quality.
At the beginning of this year, the People's Armed force party committee discovered during investigation and research at the grassroots level that some of the People's Armed Force cadres had served for a long time, had too many concurrent duties, and had not put their chief energies into the armed force work.
For this reason, they have adopted methods including centralized training, replacing training with meetings, and relying on local party schools to conduct training, thus regularly training military cadres, in an effort to resolve problems such as the narrow knowledge base and the uniform focus of the professional quality of military cadres.
In combination with the central work, they boldly assign tasks to military cadres and put more pressure on them, and raise their performance by on-the-job training.
At the same time, they have actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly drafted the "People's Armed Forces Cadres' Competition for Jobs Scheme," and explicitly stipulated that the leaders of People's Armed Forces departments must join the party committee of the same level and cannot concurrently take on other jobs.
They have set up a military cadres' restructuring exchange mechanism to promptly regulate exchanges on some older military cadres who are not suitable for grassroots People's Armed forces work, and promote and use some comrades of good comprehensive quality and strong work ability.
Not long ago, a domestic gap was filled by the underwater boat-welding technology invented and developed by the People's Militia technology platoon under the leadership of the secretary of the armed department of the New Century Shipbuilding Company Limited, Chen Yisong, who was exceptionally promoted as the company's armed department leader.
When You Start Well, You Still Need to Finish Well
Judging simply from the result of the match, 2-2 seems a reasonable score, and is also one that the Chinese team can accept.  The key problem is that the way the match went made people feel it was rather a pity.
If the Iranian team had taken a 2-0 lead, then the Chinese team had evened up the score, then the feeling that would have given China's sports fans would certainly have been different.  It would have boosted morale.  The pity was that the situation was precisely the opposite.
You could say that starting well but being unable to finish well is an old problem of the Chinese team.
The Chinese team often don't kick the ball when they have an excellent chance, and most people's view is that the psychological quality of China's players is not really up to it.
This is actually one reason why the Chinese team cannot "finish well."
However, judging by the Chinese team's match today, it may not be quite so.
Even if we set aside the fact that Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, Zheng Zhi and others have played in Europe, Li Weifeng and others are also old-timers with long experience of the battlefield.  They have experience and knowledge, and so it would be reasonable to say that there should not be any problem with their psychological quality.
The reason why the Chinese team was regrettably forced to a draw by the Iranian team this time may be because they deployed their forces in a lackadaisical manner at key points of the match.
When the Iranian team were behind, they substituted two persons, and the scene immediately seemed different.
In the second half, the Chinese team also substituted three players, but without a positive effect.
To overcome the problem of starting well but being unable to finish well, it is definitely necessary to pinpoint the source of the problem.
As long as the problem is correctly grasped, it will probably not be difficult to find a way to get rid of the problem.
The worst thing when you have a serious illness is just to go to see any doctor.
If they carry on like this, no matter how many matches the Chinese team play, the old problem will still continue, and the constant progress with every game that everyone expects will be out of the question.
Public Security Ministry Confers a Collective Award of Merit, Second Class, on Guangdong's Frontier Defense Unit Hospital
Staff Writer, Shenzhen, July 18
Report by Li Guoliang and Huang Qi: For many years, Guangdong's Frontier Defense Unit Hospital, while doing a good job ensuring army medical service, has also done all it can to aid the masses who have found themselves in straitened circumstances, their compassion soothing the hearts of the common people everywhere.
This morning, a celebratory meeting to mark the conferring by the Public Security Ministry of a Collective Ward of Merit, Second Class, on Guangdong's Frontier Defense Unit Hospital, together with a public lecture on the exemplary deeds of the army in supporting the government and cherishing the people, was solemnly held in Shenzhen.
The Guangdong Frontier Unit Hospital, which has set itself the task of building socialist harmony, has successively established three fair-price hospitals specially aimed at migrant laborers in Buji, Longhua and Bao'an of Shenzhen.  The registration fee for migrant laborers seeking medical advice is only 1 yuan, and discounts of 20% are available for both tests and operations.
The hospital is provided with a special "Compassionate Service Vehicle," which takes peasant migrant patients to and from the clinic free of charge, and has rolled out a migrant peasant worker "Health Service Card," whereby each person needs to pay just 7 yuan a month to enjoy 12 types of basic medical treatment consultations and guarantees.
These measures to benefit the people have already been extended to more than 12,000 migrant peasant workers.
Since 2003, the hospital has also launched large-scale compassionate charity consultation events under the title "Lighting a Thousand Lamps," and has organized eight successive trips to send ophthalmic doctors and nurses to distant places such as Tibet, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Qinghai to "bring light and health," performing nearly 3,000 cataract operations free of charge, helping sufferers to see again.
Armed Police to Change into 07-Series Uniform from August 1
Staff Writer, Beijing, July 19  Report by Liu Zhifeng and Correspondent Zhang Jianjun: The Armed Police will gradually change into 07-series uniform from August 1.
Today, this correspondent saw from the launch ceremony of the Armed Police 07-series uniform and the dressing demonstration event that the current uniform change altogether includes 105 types of clothing in four main categories, namely ceremonial attire, everyday uniform, drill uniform, and symbols and accessories.
The color of the uniform is being adjusted from the current olive green to deep olive green.  Ornamental trim is being sewn on all sleeve cuffs and pant side hems.  The overall design feels very modern, and national clothing specification standards have been consulted while drawing up specifications.
The large-brimmed hat of female officers and soldiers will be changed into a hat with a curled brim; the everyday winter clothing of police officers will be changed from a buttoned-up collar style to an open collar style and everyday summer clothing will be changed into a form that is tight at the waist; and everyday spring and fall clothing will be changed into a hunting dress design.
The newly added name tags, rank and qualifications badges, national defense military service badges and ribbons, as well as redesigned cap insignia, chest symbols, tie toggles, epaulets and sleeve insignia have strengthened the identification function of the clothing and improved its esthetic appearance.
The Armed Police will be issued with their 07-series uniform over 3 years.
By August 1, 2007, police officers, civilian cadres and the National Flag Guard, military orchestras, and song-and-dance troupes will be issued with their ceremonial attire in keeping with the entire military.  Police officers, civilian cadres and soldiers stationed in units in the Beijing area will be issued with their everyday spring and fall clothing, their everyday summer clothing, and identification accessories.
In May 2008 soldiers and cadets of other units will be issued with their everyday spring and fall clothing, their everyday summer clothing, and identification accessories.
In October 2008 police officers will be issued with their everyday winter clothing and everyday overcoats.
December 2009 is when soldiers will be issued with their everyday winter clothing.
Drill uniforms will gradually be issued from 2008 in line with the seasons.
"Small, Scattered, Far and Direct" Education Coordination Zones Go into Operation in a Second Artillery Unit Base
Staff Writer, Report by Xue Bingjian and Correspondent Xu Yeqing: The situation in the "small, scattered, far and direct" units where education organization is difficult, resources are meager, and each fends for itself, will become history at a second artillery unit base.
This correspondent learned recently that following a half-year pilot project, this base has handed down "The Method of Fully Implementing 'An Outline for Ideological and Political Education'."  A number of ideological and political education coordination zones covering all the "small, scattered, far and direct" units in the base have officially been brought into operation.
In order to push ahead with the effective implementation of "An Outline for Ideological and Political Education," the base organized resources at the beginning of the year to conduct in-depth investigation and research of the ideological and political education situation in "small, scattered, far and direct" units.  They combed through important issues that influence and restrict the education time, personnel and results, and initially established this new-style education model of coordination zones for the "small, scattered, far and direct" units.
The concrete approach of coordination zones is to break down the organizational boundaries among units and set up a brigade and regiment-level unit to take the lead in the areas where the "small, scattered, far and direct" units are relatively concentrated, and conduct an integrated program for thematic education, with units falling under different hierarchies coming together in nearby places for lectures or using the help of video link-up systems for remote discussions.
They have adopted a method that integrates taking turns in giving lessons and competing for posts, and unifying the allocation of educational resources.  In each area the use of educational hardware will be integrated, and each unit's materials, data and educational experiences will be shared and exchanged with those of others, with regular organization in each area of typical tour reports and exchanges of what they got from the study by the officers and men.
Every coordination zone has set up a devoted educational liaison person and a part-time educational information gatherer.
On this basis, each coordination zone has also set up systems for seeking assistance on difficult issues, holding joint discussions on major educational themes, reporting critical ideological situations, and assessing tests and evaluations.
Zhang Shengmin, the director of the base's political department, told this correspondent that constructing political education coordination zones has both reduced the waste of educational resources and deepened the impact of education.
Some political instructors fear they will lose marks in front of officers and men from other units and have taken the initiative to study new things and seek new educational methods.
The officers and men receiving the education have also enthusiastically digested the educational content, out of concern over expressing themselves in layman's language in front of the officers and men of friendly neighboring units during discussion and analysis.
In this way, the enthusiasm of the people giving and receiving education has been both effectively stimulated.
A North China Sea Fleet Repair Brigade Fully Allocates its R&R Quota to Sailors
Staff Writer, Report by Zhang Junhong and Liu Hongjun: On July 17, led by vice-chief engineer Zhang Weiliang of a North China Sea fleet repair brigade, 31 of the brigade's long-serving frontline repair sailors happily stepped on a train to go to Beidaihe for a period of rest and recuperation.
Luo Xiangming, an NCO class, happily told this writer, "That the brigade's leaders care about and cherish the sailors deeply moves us.  After a period of rest and recuperation, we will definitely work doubly hard!"
This is actually the first time that this brigade has organized rest and recuperation for grassroots sailors.
Not long ago, the brigade commander Yao Qingsheng went down to the grassroots units and saw that sailors responsible for repair work were braving high temperatures to carry out equipment maintenance and repair work, deeply moving Yao Qingsheng.
"As the sailors work selflessly, the party committee should care about and cherish the sailors, and take responsibility for the sailors' health."  At a meeting of the party committee, Yao Qingsheng's words were endorsed by everyone.
After looking into the matter, the party committee reached a decision to give the entire R&R quota allocated to the brigade by senior authorities to the sailors doing repair work on the frontline.
Doing Things Openly in a Ji'nan Military Command Unit Takes Heat off "Hot-Button Issues"
Staff Writer
Report by Wang Weiqin and Specially Contracted Correspondent Li Deying: On July 25, this writer observed in a service support company of the Ji'nan Military Command that invitations for an army engineering tender, details of financial expenditure, promotions of cadres, non-commissioned officers being admitted to the Party and other major matters were written up on a bulletin board, and hung up conspicuously in a display cabinet.
As Political Commissar Su Chengsen explained, this is a concrete measure adopted by the section to promote a system where things are done openly.
At the beginning of this year, the unit party committee drew up measures including "Two-way Supervision Between the Organization and the Grassroots" and "Publicizing Sensitive Issues" to strengthen the construction of the party spirit and honest government, requiring that for all significant issues that involve the direct interests of the officers and men and army development, the opinions of grassroots officers and men are first heard before decisions are reached, and that standards, procedures, and results etc of the handling of the matters are made public from start to finish in line with the circumstances.
The unit has installed a suggestion box and a bulletin board, and has opened a "message board" on its Intranet to collect everyone's views and recommendations in an extensive way.
At the beginning of the year, as the renovation project of the soldiers' barracks was about to start, before the work began, the party committee organ extensively solicited the views of the officers and men, and then released the information on inviting bids, implementing a system of open tenders.
This both saved money and won the support of the officers and men.
Doing things in an open and fair way has driven the formation of a good atmosphere at the grassroots.
In this unit, the grassroots company insists on making regular public announcements and notices, no matter whether they are issues as big as the determination of "hot-button" sensitive matters, or as trivial as personal vacations to visit relatives or daily income and expenditure in the mess accounts, thus taking the initiative to receive the supervision of the masses.
(International) Research Shows a Link between Arrhythmia and Two Forms of Genetic Variation
Xinhua News Agency, London,  July 2  Icelandic scientists have discovered through research that the risk of arrhythmia among people with two types of genetic variation in their bodies is far greater than among ordinary people.
According to a report in the latest issue of Nature magazine, after researchers at Iceland's deCode Genetics Inc sifted through the genes of thousands of people from Iceland, Sweden, and the US, as well as China's Hong Kong region, they made the above-mentioned discovery.
The two genes discovered by the scientists are located close to a gene that plays an important role in the early growth of the heart.
Arrhythmia, namely atrial fibrillation, is one of the most common clinically observed irregularities of the rhythm of the heart, and can lead to heart palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness as well as apoplectic fits.
And according to a report in the Nature Genetics magazine that came out on the 1st, researchers at deCode Genetics Inc have also discovered two genes on the 17th chromosome in human beings that is connected to the onset of cancer in the prostate gland.  They play some role in more than one-third of cases of cancer in the prostate gland.
The research also discovered that one of the genes, while increasing people's risk of suffering from the cancer of the prostate gland, also lowered the risk of suffering from Type 2 diabetes.
(Sports) Veteran US Goalkeeper Keller May Retire after America's Cup
Xinhua News Agency, Maracaibo (Venezuela) July 3 (Correspondent Liu Jian)
According to a report in the Venezuelan media on the 3rd, the US team's 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper, Keller, said during an interview here that if he could not find a suitable club to serve in after the America's Cup, then he would opt to retire.
"If I have not been able to get a contract for 1-2 seasons with a high-quality league team within four to six weeks of the conclusion of the America's Cup, then maybe retiring will not be a bad choice for me."
With the relegation of the Möchengladbach team to the 2nd Bundesliga, Keller also left this soccer team in which he had served for more than two seasons.
Although Keller has a mind to retire, he has many opportunities and clearly need not worry about finding a place.  He himself has frankly stated that there are currently as many as eight soccer teams that are interested in inviting him to join them.
However, this veteran goalkeeper who has served in league matches for the Spanish Primera Liga, the English Premiership, and the German Bundesliga, said that what he ultimately chooses to do will be decided by his family.  "My kid is already 9 years old.  He has followed me around and stayed in three different countries, and has been to three different schools, and so I need to consider in my current choice what would be better for my family."
In the Gold Cup competition that was concluded not long ago, Keller put in an outstanding performance, helping the US team to win the title.
In the current America's cup, he has, just as before, been given an important job to do by head coach Bradley, but he clearly cannot win the match singlehanded.  The US team, made up of "young guards," is no match for such strong South American opponents as Argentina and Paraguay, and during these two matches the goal he guarded was breached seven times.
The next match against Colombia will probably be the US team's and Keller's last performance in this America's Cup competition.
(Overseas China-related) Blackberry Intelligent Cellphone to Land on the Chinese Market at the End of August
Xinhua News Agency,  Ottawa,  July 4  According to a report on the 4th in Canada's Globe and Mail, after eight years of hard work, the Canadian RIM company's Blackberry intelligent cellphone has finally received authorization to enter the Chinese market.  The first Blackberry cellphone model will come on the market in China at the end of August.
RIM Chief Executive Officer Jim Balsillie said that Blackberry cellphone services would be rolled out to business customers in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
The Globe and Mail quoted a manager at RIM's office in Beijing as saying that the 8700g model Blackberry intelligent cellphone would be launched on the Chinese market at the end of August, that the sales price will be around 700 US dollars, and that at present 5,000 orders have already been received.
Balsillie said that the launch on the market last week of Apple Inc's iPhone had made people more and more aware of intelligent cellphones, and that Blackberry cellphones are currently being sold in more than 100 countries around the globe as a competitor of iPhone.
According to statistics, in the first quarter of this year, new users of RIM's Blackberry cellphones reached 1.2 million, with the overall number of users reaching 9.2 million.
(International) Spain: Husband who Wore Mask to Kill his Wife Is Arrested
Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, July 7  A Spanish woman was attacked by a masked hoodlum, and during the struggle she pulled off the hoodlum's face covering and was surprised to find that the assaulter was actually her own husband.  The police have arrested him.
According to a report in the media over here on the 6th, the woman works in a bakery in the city of Valencia.
One day, a masked man stormed into the shop, and she thought he was a robber and told him to take some money from the drawer and get out.
But instead of taking any money, the man grabbed the women by the neck and tried to kill her.
She tried to pretend she was dead to escape her fate, but the man still did not let her go and carried on kicking her and choking her by the neck.
In the struggle, the women pulled down the villain's face covering, but found to her surprise that the man was actually her husband.
The assaulter has been arrested by the police.
The female victim told the media that she and her husband are in the middle of divorce procedures because of their failure to get along with each other, and they have two children.
The Resignation of 13 Pilots Leads China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company to a Countersuit for Compensation of More than 100 Million Yuan
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan,  July 11 (Correspondents Liu Yang and Pi Shuchu)
When 13 pilots  handed in their resignations, their "boss," the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Co. Ltd asked them for compensation for a huge sum of up to 105 million.  This is the largest sum claimed in damages so far in a labor dispute case in Hubei province.
The Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province is currently trying this case.
In May this year, 13 pilots with China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company in succession handed in their resignations, which were rejected by the company.
Soon afterwards, the pilots applied one after another at the beginning of June to the Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province for labor arbitration, requesting for a ruling that their labor relationship with China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company be terminated.
After China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company received notice of the suit, it advanced a counterclaim and requested that the 13 pilots pay for losses caused by their breaking their labor contract agreements and canceling their labor contracts, ranging from more than 6 million yuan to 10 million yuan respectively, totaling 105 million yuan.
It has been learned that the labor contract the pilots signed with China Eastern Airlines was of unfixed duration.  Unless the conditions agreed in the labor contract for breaking off or canceling the agreement applied, the labor contract was to remain in force until the pilots' legal retirement age.
The Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province will try and deal with this case as a suit and a countersuit together, and it is hoped that the hearing will be over by August 8.
(International) Germany Calls on Russia to Ratify Latvian-Russian Border Treaty as Soon as Possible
Xinhua News Agency, Riga, July 12 (Correspondent Yang Dehong) German Foreign Minister Steinmeier currently visiting Latvia called on Russia on the 12th to ratify the Latvian-Russian border treaty as soon as possible.
On that day Steinmeier held talks with Latvian Foreign Minister Pabriks.  The two sides mainly discussed issues such as Latvian-German relations and Latvian cooperation with the EU, and exchanged opinions and views on the development of Latvian-Russian relations and EU-Russian relations.
In the press conference held after the talks, Steinmeier called on Russia to ratify the Latvian-Russian border treaty as soon as possible.
Steinmeier said that steps towards an improvement in relations between Latvia and all the countries in the Baltic Sea region and Russia have been relatively slow, and that the process of signing the Latvian-Russian border treaty bears witness to a process of development in Latvian-Russian relations, but "the shadow of history" may also cause Latvian-Russian relations to go backwards once again.  He hoped that Russia can ratify the Latvian-Russian border treaty as soon as possible, in order to promote forward development in the two countries' relationship.
On March 27 this year, after talks lasting 10 years, Latvian Prime Minister Kalvitis and Russian Prime Minister Fradkov signed a bilateral border treaty in Moscow.
On May 17 the Latvian parliament ratified the Latvian-Russian border treaty.
According to a report in the Latvian media, the Russian parliament will hold a vote on the treaty in the near future.
(International) North and South Korea to Hold Sixth Colonel-Level Military Talks
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang,  July 16  (Correspondents Gao Haorong and Xia Yu)
Representatives of the militaries of North Korea and South Korea held military talks and routine contacts in Panmunjom on the 16th, and the two sides agreed after discussion that they will hold their sixth colonel-level military talks from the 24th to the 26th.
According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's military representative and senior colonel in the Korean People's Army, Pak Rim Su, brought forward a proposal during that day's contact to set up a joint fishing zone in North Korea's West Sea between Yonphyong island to Paekryong island, and gave a detailed explanation of the rationale for it.
He said that in order to set up a joint fishing zone, it is necessary to implement the principles such as those of seeking maximum common national prosperity and benefits and of safeguarding peaceful and secure fishing operations.
While talking about the issue of the bilaterally disputed maritime border, Pak Rim Su said that in order to prevent military conflict between the two sides in the West Sea, the two sides should renounce the maritime borders they have hitherto insisted on, recognize and respect each other's rights to territorial seas, and accept as the basis for negotiations the relevant agreements between North Korea and South Korea, the Korean armistice agreement, and internationally recognized law.
He said that the "persistent standpoint" of the North Korean military was to promptly draw up military safeguard measures in order to promote cooperative exchanges between North and South Korea.
He said that the South Korean side should adopt military measures right now to ensure that North Korean civilian vessels can sail directly south from Haeju port and freely pass through the Jeju Straits.
This has been the second round of military talks and routine contacts held recently between both North and South Korea since the 10th of this month.
The fifth colonel-level military talks between North and South Korea was held on May 8-11 in Panmunjom in a "unity pavilion" on the North Korean side.
(International) Hyundai Motor Denies Its Intention to Buy Volvo
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, July 18  A spokesperson for the South Korean Hyundai Motor Company said in Seoul on the 18th that the company had no intention of buying Volvo or any brand controlled by the Ford Motor Company.
The Sunday Times and the New York Times both recently reported the news that Ford may sell off Volvo.
The Sunday Times further said in its report that the South Korean Hyundai Motor Company is a potential buyer of Volvo.
A spokesperson for Hyundai Motor Company said, "We don't have any interest in buying Volvo, Jaguar or Rover," and "at this moment Hyundai is busy implementing its own expansion plan, and basically has no time for other things."
In 1999 Ford spent 6.45 billion US dollars buying the Volvo brand from the Swedish Volvo Group.
At present, Volvo together with Rover and Jaguar etc fall under Ford's Premier Automotive Group (PAG).
In March this year, Ford, which has fallen into financial deficit, sold the PAG-affiliated Aston Martin for 848 million US dollars.  Last month, it also said it is considering selling Rover and Jaguar.
(Sports) Cuba Complains a Boxing Ring's Rope is Too Short
Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, July 21 (Correspondents Chen Weihua and Leng Tong)
The Cuban delegation complained on the 21st that the rope around the boxing ring at this Pan-American Games is too short and will affect the boxers' performance.
According to the regulations of the International Boxing Union, during international matches the rope around the boxing ring should be 6.1 meters, but according to measurements by the Cuban delegation's boxing team coach, Pedro Roque, the length of the rope around the boxing ring at this Pan-American Games is over 1 meter shorter than the norm.
Roque said, "We have submitted a formal protest, because this matter does not affect just one country, Cuba, but involves everyone.
An excessively short rope will affect the boxers' dodging movements."
He also joked, "If they can't find a rope conforming to Olympic standards in Rio, they can go and look somewhere else.
If we had known earlier, we would have brought one from Cuba."
The Mexican and Colombian delegations also expressed dissatisfaction on that day with the length of the rope around the boxing ring.
Although the Colombian boxer, Julio Deibis, won the first match, he said, "Although I have won the first game, the boxing ring is too narrow, and in fact made me feel uncomfortable."
Exports of White Rabbit Candy Resumed as Overseas Distributors Increase Their Orders
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 24  (Correspondents Xu Shousong and Yu Lihong) The correspondents learned from Guan Sheng Yuan (Group) Co. Ltd that exports of White Rabbit candy held up for a time at the Shanghai port have recently been resumed, and a considerable number of overseas agents have one after another increased their orders.
Mr. Lim Cheng Eng of the Hock Lam company, Guan Sheng Yuan's distributor in Singapore, recently called the Guan Sheng Yuan Group to say that since the result of a sample examination of White Rabbit candy by Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority showed that they did not contain formaldehyde and could be sold on the market normally, he wanted to place additional orders.
Guan Sheng Yuan's Malaysian distributor, the Feng Sheng company, said that it had asked Guan Sheng Yuan to immediately dispatch a container of the White Rabbit candy to Malaysia from Shanghai.
Guan Sheng Yuan's distributor in Hong Kong, Ng Fung Trading Co. Ltd, also phoned Guan Sheng Yuan to say that Hong Kong's Center for Food Safety had taken random samples of White Rabbit candy from a Hong Kong supermarket and chemicals tests had confirmed that they do not contain formaldehyde.
Ng Fung Trading Co. Ltd has received notification from Hong Kong's China Resources Supermarket of its decision to resume sales of White Rabbit candy in its more than 100 stores in Hong Kong.
It is learned that 10 containers of White Rabbit candy that had been held up for a time at the Shanghai port have gradually resumed exportation.
At present, 7 containers of White Rabbit candy are being dispatched to countries including Singapore, Costa Rica, Malaysia, India, Nepal, and the US.
(International) Man Suspected of Making Bomb Threats to a British Supermarket Is Arrested
Xinhua News Agency, London, July 26  The British police announced on the 26th that a man suspected of making bomb threats to the British supermarket Tesco in mid-July was arrested on the 23rd in Clitheroe, Lancashire.
The police said that this man, named Philip McHugh, is 51 years old and unemployed.  He will be charged with blackmail and creating bomb scare.
On the afternoon of July 14 ( Saturday), 14 branches nationwide of the supermarket Tesco in Britain were shut by the police as an emergency as a result of bomb threats, and were only able to resume their business on the following day.
Saturday is the peak time for British people to go to the supermarket and do their shopping, and the closure of 14 supermarkets at that time caused Britain's largest supermarket chain to lose millions of pounds of sales revenue.
The British police carried out a criminal investigation into this bomb threat case soon afterwards and announced that they did not find any traces of terrorist activity in this case, but there were probably some economic motives behind it.
(Sports) Plants Change Season to Blossom "Out of Season" for the Beijing Olympic Games
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 28 (Correspondent Cui Junqiang) When the Olympic Games are held next year, Beijing is expected to turn into a sea of fresh flowers in hot and humid August.
By season-altering and other technological methods, scientific and research personnel have found a good way of adding more color to the Olympic Games.
At the "Practical Research into the Selection and Cultivation of New Plant Varieties for the Summer Olympics" project evaluation meeting held on the 28th in Beijing, the experts making the evaluation came to the conclusion that by the use of new rapid-control cultivation technologies, plant species or varieties with different natural flowering seasons could blossom at the same time in the summer and reach an optimum result for people to enjoy in August when the Beijing Olympics are held.
In the summer in Beijing, one can usually see only a dozen or so fresh flowers in full bloom, as the majority of flowering plants have either long withered or are far away from blossoming.
The scientific and research personnel worked hard to select 206 species and more than 400 varieties of plants for the Summer Olympic Games.
At the "2007 Olympic Games Plant and Flower Show" to be held in Beijing's Haidian park around the one year countdown before the Beijing Olympics open, a batch of plants meticulously cultivated by scientific and research personnel that previously could not naturally flower in August will welcome visitors with their gaily-colored flowers.
(International) Turkey's Ruling Party Wins Parliamentary Election
Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, July 30 (Correspondent Wang Jian) The final results of the 23rd round of parliamentary election announced by Turkey's Supreme Election Commission on the 30th show that the ruling Justice and Development Party won 341 of the 550 parliamentary seats, once again winning the right to form a single-party government.
In the parliamentary election held on July 22, the main opposition Republican People's Party won 112 parliamentary seats.
The Nationalist Action Party won 71 parliamentary seats in the election.
Apart from the above-mentioned political parties, 26 independents were also elected as members of parliament.
The new Turkish parliament will hold its first meeting on August 4.
At that time, all of the members of parliament will be sworn in and will begin to carry out their duties.
After this, the parliament will elect a new speaker by means of a secret ballot.
The Turkish parliamentary election was originally scheduled to be held in November, but during the presidential election at the end of April the boycott of the opposition parties against the only candidate -- Deputy PrimeMinister and Foreign Minister Gul, who belongs to the Justice and Development Partyl -- led to the failure of the presidential elections, consequently bringing forward the parliamentary election.
CCDI, I'm Worried about the Effectiveness of Your "Anti-corruption Deadline"
Posted by [Guchanhuo] at 2007-07-02 14:41:10 [send a message] [full view]
On May 30, the CCDI gave corrupt bribe-takers all over the country a time limit of one month, that is, by June 30, if they have not voluntarily confessed before the deadline, it will catch them.
As a man on the street, when I heard this, I couldn't help laughing.  When the police are catching thieves, do they tell the thieves a month in advance, hurry and voluntarily confess, otherwise we'll catch you?  What kind of corruption fighting is that???
Isn't this just the same as explicitly telling corrupt officials in advance to get running and quickly shift the incriminating evidence???
What's the point in that?
It'll definitely...Oh, I simply don't have the words.
To look at it another way, even if it really does work, how effective will it be?
Will it be able to inhibit and deter corrupt officials?
We don't exclude the possibility that there will be cowards among them who will come and voluntarily confess, but won't there definitely be more who run?
And regardless of whether or not there has been a significant result when the CCDI's anti-corruption deadline has arrived, but it might have served another purpose.
That is that corrupt officials everywhere have all got the message and privately rejoice.  They will all thank the CCDI.
One month is enough time to quickly transfer your assets.
If I were a corrupt official, I would absolutely be thinking this as well and I would absolutely not go to you to voluntarily declare them, either.
Apart from celebrating their luck, corrupt officials will all be saying this: haha, thanks very much...
Ordinary people honestly can't understand it at all, what's with this corruption fighting?  Why is it so hard to just enforce it quickly and effectively, to take decisive action?
And will this kind of corruption fighting be of much use?
In summary, the CCDI, I'm worried about the effectiveness of your "anti-corruption deadline."
Not Privatizing Land is the Bottom Line for My Reason and Calmness

Not Privatizing Land is the Bottom Line for My Reason and Calmness
I think I'm someone who doesn't easily lose his temper.  That's my own feeling, at least.
I've always been reasonable and calm when posting on this forum.  Very rare have been the occasions when I have lost my reason and talked nonsense.
I've also always had a great deal of trust and sincere expectations of the central Party.  No matter how much their reform measures didn't fit with my ideas, I could accept them all, and see this as one of their "characteristics."
But as soon as land starts to be privatized (or covertly privatized), the existing basis of all this will be lost.
It is better to lose a thousand soldiers than to give up an inch of land.  Our national land resources are indeed our greatest social resources.
The working people and the national land resources are the roots of a nation.
If only the character of the national land resources doesn't change, the character of the nation will not very easily alter.  As soon as the character of the national land resources changes, then basically everything changes.
I'm not a member of the Communist Party, but I remember clearly that I have sworn this oath: "I love the motherland, I love the people; I will study well and keep myself fit, to prepare for: contributing my effort to the cause of communism!"
"I will study diligently, work hard, put hard work before leisure, and struggle for the cause of communism!"
Those people who like me have sworn these oaths and have loudly sung, "We are the heirs of socialism," should be able to remember the oaths they have made if they are not too shameless.
If you have broken your own oath, then please honestly stand up and leave the side of "communism."  Don't hoax the masses holding on to this placard, while thinking about how to sell the placard for a good price.
Of course, I hope that all of these worries are needless.  I hope that I will be able to maintain my reasonableness and calm always.
You should remember, "We are the heirs of socialism."
If there's nothing to inherit, what do we do then?
One Generation, Experience of Two Eras
A while ago, someone asked: are there any thirty-year-old Mao supporters?
Later, it was changed to twenty-year-olds.
Actually people of this age group didn't experience the Mao Zedong era at all.  I don't know if the person who asked this question has had their brains washed away or if they were born dumb.
In the cities, those with the most right to talk about the Mao Zedong era should be those who experienced those years for themselves.  It's the people who suffered the torments of +those years.  That is to say, it should be people who were born between 1950 and 1960.
After they were born, their parents were taking part in campaigns and didn't give their children the appropriate love.
Just when they needed nutrition, they landed in three years of natural disaster and suffered the hardships of hunger.
When they started school, again they met with the Cultural Revolution, and several years of their education were wasted.
Some of them even terminated their education forever.  When they were 15-17 years old, and had not finished their education, they were forced to abandon their studies and respond to the call of the Party to go into remote areas and villages and to reinforce the border areas.
After they started work, they thought that the laboring class was the most honorable, so they voluntarily chose the dirtiest and hardest work.
Their honor was short-lived; their mediocrity stuck with them for a lifetime.
When they were old enough to get married, getting married late, having children late and having only one child started with them.
+When they should have been getting +raises, the companies valued diplomas.  Because they didn't have diplomas, the +raises didn't come.
They worked hard to bring up their children and give their children a full basic education.  When their children got into universities, they met with the double whammy of reform in the education system and reform of the state-owned enterprises.  Tuition fees went up, and they were laid off.
As their age increased day by day, they started to get ill, and again they were unlucky in meeting with the reform of the healthcare system.  This meant that their diseased bodies couldn't get treatment because they couldn't pay the medical bills.
We can see that all of the unfairness in society fell mercilessly on the people of their generation.
But among these people there aren't many who are against Mao Zedong or who attack Mao Zedong.
Why?
They're not Mao Zedong's slaves.  They're flesh and blood, living right here among the people and groups of our society.  The history of their personal experiences, from going to the remote areas and villages to being laid off from their jobs, encapsulates the social phenomena of two eras.
Even though they are very unhappy about or even hate their wasted education, not having enough to eat, not having warm clothes, and some bad social phenomena during the Mao Zedong era, they still think the Mao Zedong era was good in terms of the national spirit, morality in personal relationships, and social practices
The parents of some of you netizens are precisely people of this generation.  You can chat about it with them.

"Injected Watermelons," "Cancer Bananas," and "Cardboard Buns"
Posted by [Wasteland Beyond the Great Wall] at 2007-07-19 22:02:57 [send a message] [full view] I remember there was news two years ago of watermelons in Hainan being injected with chemical drugs by someone using a syringe.  The result was that a load of Hainan watermelons rotted in the field, and a lot of watermelon farmers got no return on their expenses.
CCTV later did a follow-up report, and it turned out that they proved there had never been any such thing.
This report was weird from the beginning, because if you wanted to inject large watermelons with a syringe one by one, it would not only have no real point, it would also be impossible because of the amount of work.
My memory from last year is clearer.  There were reports in the media saying that banana trees in Hainan were suffering from a disease similar to human cancer, and that the diseased banana trees were very likely to die.
The result was that it was misunderstood by lots of people to be that if you ate bananas you'd get cancer.  The result was the same again.  The price of Hainan bananas dropped steeply, making the banana farmers cry till they had no more tears left and complain on and on.
The reason why the two reports above both caused such a stir was because they directly touched on people's most sensitive nerve, i.e. the issue of food safety.
If the media says such-and-such a food may threaten our health, then it will definitely get relayed ten times, and those ten times relayed a hundred times.  Towards the subject involved, people generally prefer to take an attitude of better to believe it than not.  For a single person, eating a few less Hainan watermelons, bananas, etc., is no big deal, after all.  But for the producers and sellers of those products, the impact gets very big.
Not long ago, another storm burst in Beijing over food safety.  It was that people had gone so far as to use processed cardboard boxes as the filling when making buns because the price of pork had gone up.  These were "cardboard buns."
When I heard this I was also deeply shocked.  I thought these stallholders have an amazing ability to find new tricks, if they've managed to think up this kind of method to cheat people.  Moreover, I then passed on this piece of news to many people and warned my family and friends not to buy any more buns when they go out on the streets.
But yesterday there was suddenly another piece of news saying that the cardboard buns report was fake news, and the whole thing was made up by one person.  Now at the same time as I'm feeling relieved I'm also very puzzled.  What on earth is with the media these days?
The facts of the matter that I've found out from reliable sources are: a temporary employee of the program "Transparency" on the Beijing TV lifestyle channel, Zi something, took some pork filling himself that he'd bought from the market, flour and cardboard, and instructed Wei someone and other people to soak the cardboard in water, mix it into the pork filling, and make it into buns.
Zi something used a domestic digital video camera that he'd taken to record the manufacturing process, then edited it and used tricks to get it broadcast.
Now the police have already detained the criminal suspect Zi someone in accordance with the law, and will deal with him severely in accordance with the law.
Since the bun incident occurred, the government has quickly organized the relevant departments to launch an investigation, and is conducting a thorough, comprehensive probe into Beijing's breakfast market to guarantee safety on the public's dining tables.
Since the truth of the incident was confirmed, Beijing TV has made a public apology to the public and has learned an important lesson.  It has investigated and dealt with the relevant responsible people severely, and will further strengthen management, stop up leak points, and resolutely put an end to false and untrue news reports.
But even though the cardboard buns were pure fabrications, when everyone will dare to go again with confidence to the stalls to buy buns is as yet an unknown.
This incident also reflects from one perspective the importance that the government places on food safety and the speed of its action.  And to an extent it also shows that the dining tables of the Beijing public are still fairly safe.  The false alarm of the bun incident has also been a reminder for everyone!
To Whom Do We Owe a Duty in Education?
Recently I've heard friends back home talking about some news from a school, and I have to have my say about this.
It all happened at a private middle school in Shanghai - South West Weiyu Middle School.
The school decided to arrange the best teachers for three classes of students from the school's own junior middle school who had signed contracts on direct admission to the senior middle school.  And it got some young teachers with unimpressive teaching records and no experience of teaching high school seniors to teach some other classes which had been admitted from other schools after examination or had not signed contracts for admission to this school.
The reason was: the students who signed contracts agreed at that time not to take the examinations for other senior middle schools, so the school must guarantee the best teachers for them according to the agreement.
And the school's attitude to the students in other classes was: you should give young teachers the opportunity to gain experience.
This couldn't but make me wonder, to whom do we really owe a duty in education?
I remember when I studied at a key senior middle school many years ago, all of the students in my class were unhappy with the quality of one math teacher's teaching.  Despite the complexity of things, we collectively signed a request that the school change our teacher.
In the end, the school really did give us another teacher, because the school's promise to us was that it would treat every student equally, that it would do its duty by every student.
Ten years ago I came to the US to study for a postgraduate degree.
One summer, when I was choosing my courses for the next semester, I found that all the elective courses the department had arranged were all heavily theoretical courses, and they hadn't arranged any of some more practical courses.
I went to talk to the head of the department and told him I thought there was a problem with the curriculum.
The head of the department admitted that the reason the curriculum did not include any practical courses was because of a lack of teachers.  In one or two years when they had teachers, they would be able to offer them.
I remember I said to him then: "This is your problem, not mine.
The reason I came halfway round the world from Shanghai to study at this school was because I was attracted by the introduction of your curriculum.
If you can't offer these courses, then don't put them in the introduction, otherwise it's false advertising.  It's failing to do your duty by me and my family."
After listening to what I said, the department head thought for a while and then said, Well, I'll see what we can do to solve this.
It may be already too late, because all of the courses have already been arranged and registered online.
Three weeks later, the head of department came to talk to me, basically to tell me that his work was to take care of every student, including me.
He had listened to my advice and made his best efforts.  He had added two practical electives, and hoped I could understand.
After this happened, I took a few courses taught by the head of department.
He never showed any bias against me because I'd complained to him.  In every class he very fairly gave me an A.
The night before graduation, I heard his secretary say that he did everything he could for every student, but not all the students were grateful to him.
During the graduation ceremony, when I was making a speech on behalf of the honors students, I told the head of department: all of us in our hearts appreciated everything he'd done for us, because he had done all he could to do his duty by everyone of us.
I felt that I had made the right choice in life by coming to this school.
As I said this, I saw a glint of tears in the department head's eyes...If one day every education worker in China and the whole education system can do their duty by every single student, then I think China's golden age won't be far away.
Central NY Men's 4s Volleyball Tournament
Last Sunday I took part in the Central NY Men's 4s Volleyball Tournament.  I played for six and a half hours, and in the end our team won the championship.
This tournament was actually a warm-up tournament organized as preparation for taking part in the volleyball tournament at the summer sports games in New York(Empire State Games).
The coach split up Central NY's four participating men's teams (the high-school team, the college team, the over-35s team and the over-45s team) and rearranged them into four-person teams, with a setter in each team, and started the matches.
The tournament rules were a lot of fun.  You could only do back row attacks, you couldn't dink the ball inside the three-meter line, only one setter was allowed to block, and there were no substitutions.
So basically it was a test of spiking power and judgment and blocking in defense.
Our team had a 2m opposite hitter, who was both our strongest man and our tallest man in attack.  He took care of 60% of our attacks and points in the tournament.  One 1.85m setter solo blocked at the net and roofed a lot of attacks.
A 1.90m middle hitter made quite a few mistakes in attack because he was in the back row.
And then there was me, a 1.75m spiker, making the occasional sneak attack, with a quite acceptable success rate.  I mainly received the other team's cross-court spikes.
There were seven teams in total.  First was a round robin.  After my team won one match, the referee kept judging that our opposite hitter had fouled by stepping on the line while spiking.  This had a big impact on our morale, and in no time we'd lost three matches in a row.
But after we'd lost, everyone calmed down, and our teamwork also came together during these three matches, so we started a winning streak.
After the round robin, my team had won three, lost three.  Because of our low scores, we were in 6th position.
Then we started the playoffs.  Apart from the team in first place, all the teams placed 2 through 7 played against one another in the elimination round.
Our team was psychologically and tactically settled, so we played hard and took no prisoners.  We led all the way and got into the semi-finals.
Our opponents in the semi-finals were good in attack but weak in defense.  My arms got beaten black and blue, but when I did manage to save a hard spike, the level of satisfaction was twice that I got by scoring from spiking the ball myself.
I didn't even know what the final score was when we won.
The opponents in the final had balanced attack and defense.  Our serves broke a lot of their attacks, and we led from the beginning.
Finally we had match point at 21-24, and our opponents made two serves in a row that I couldn't control.  At 23-24 our opposite hitter came over and said to me, it doesn't matter, it's only two shots.
The next shot came flying at me again, but it was okay, I passed it quite well, the setter back-passed it to the opposite hitter, and a hard spike finished the competition.
Another Thing about Morality
I've already said a lot about morality for isolated free individuals.
On this subject I haven't got anything worth repeating.
What I want to say now concerns groups.
We often meet situations that require groups.
In these situations, there is a need for groups to have some morality.
We can often find some very good morals in groups that have achieved success.
This is no coincidence.
Because for these causes or activities, we need to overcome some of the difficulties before us, to pull together, rid ourselves of those elements based on faith.  I think it's those good morals that also play a role that can't be ignored.
At the very least, a group of people with very low moral standards will find it very difficult to complete any successful major project together.  This can be predicted with great confidence.
Perhaps it is because the wisdom that enables one to see the long term interests with reasoned and forward vision is a necessary quality for success in a group.
In reality, groups often use all kinds of methods to obtain an identity, for example, logos, jargon, beliefs, etc. etc., and also morality.
Only if you have rosé in the morning and rosé in the evening will your life be a bed of roses.
[Discussion] How Many Times in Your Life Have You Been Truly Happy?
A good friend of mine from senior middle school has finally got her visa and will set out at the end of August for a top school on the west coast of the USA to study for a postgraduate degree.
Today a few people from my school got together, and we were truly glad for her.  At last she'd got what she wanted.
Seeing her so happy, I was really envious.
I thought, I'm all grown up, but I've only been that happy the time I passed my exams to get into senior middle school.  At the time I'd never thought I'd be able to get into the well-known school ranked first or second in the entire city.  Later, I went predictably on to go to college and get a job.  In all that time I was never so happy again.
When I passed the exams to get into college, it wasn't the one I'd aimed for before, so you couldn't say I was particularly happy.
During my time at college, the only thing that kept me going was that after graduating I could go up north and get together with a guy who I'd been in love with for two years.
But fate always intervenes, and a month before I graduated, he broke up with me.  All of my fantasies from before collapsed.
Later I just went back to the north to work.  Now I've been working for nearly two years, and I've made enough money for a mid-range car, but I haven't ever felt that happy again.
Chatting with my good friend today, I was really able to feel her happiness.  Having slaved in preparation for a year, beside herself with worry, she has finally succeeded in getting abroad, and is going to start a new life.  That feeling of a dream coming true really makes one very happy.
I haven't planned to carry on studying, and I don't like living overseas either, because I worked overseas for half a year before, and found that life abroad doesn't actually suit me.
Having seen how happy my friend was, I couldn't help thinking, what are my goals?
What can make me that happy again?
Perhaps it's finding someone who really loves me, and is willing to stay with me for the rest of our lives.
I think at that time I'll be excited enough to cry, just as my good friend said to me, when she passed the embassy interview and got her clearance certificate, she couldn't stop herself crying.  A year of hard work and worry had finally been rewarded.
And me?
In relationships, I've given the most meticulous care, putting my heart into it over and over.  When will I also get what I want, and cry for happiness?
Perhaps I'm just a loser.  I've never worried about my career, but what about my love life?
When will my love life sort itself out?
I've always felt down on this issue.
What about you, all you boys and girls?
How many times in your lives have you been truly happy?
A Big Advertisement for the School of Architecture, South East University
Haha, and this also counts as letting SEU alumni know what's going on at the School of Architecture.
The latest first-hand news, plus my own comments -- Refund guaranteed if it's fake.
Dean Wang, Secretary An, Professor Li of the personnel office, as well as several other lecturers from the architectural technology and science teaching and research office, attended the presentation.  I talked for an hour, and then everyone discussed it for about an hour and a half.
After the official presentation finished, Professor Zhang (assistant to the dean of the school) pulled me aside and said to me, let's go into the back office, shut the door and have a talk.
He was extremely friendly.  He closed the door and told me that at formal meetings there are some things that it's better not to say.  He said that it was clear that I had no basic idea about my future income, and then told me some specifics about the incomes of lecturers at the School of Architecture to stop me worrying.
Dean Wang had given an overview of the School of Architecture before the presentation.  He said that there were six key architecture-related programs in total across the country.  There are two at SEU, two at Tsinghua, one at Tongji, and one at Tianjin Univ.  There are none apart from these.
He said that in the past few years the State has laid a special emphasis on conserving energy resources in building, "green" architecture, and architectural science and technology, and that SEU wanted to bring in a lecturer in this area.
He said they'd received over 20 resumes that came in one after another, applying for this position.  There were locals, there were Japanese, there were Americans (apparently just one: me).
The School of Architecture saw this as very important, and examined the applicants very carefully.
Compared with some of the other architecture schools in colleges that I know, SEU really is pretty cutting edge.  Tongji's urban planning is probably a shade better than SEU, but it seems that SEU may still be a little ahead in terms of architectural design (This is something I hadn't realized before.)
Dean Wang said that in the last two years the School of Architecture's funding had been more than adequate.  It was one of the key schools being developed in the National 985 Project.
He told me that last year, the government gave lump-sum funding of 10 million in development expenses to the SEU SoA.  Of this, 3.5 million was spent directly on buying books to enrich the School of Architecture's specialist library (haha, even I want to give a big thumbs up to this: a generous deed!
).  The rest of it was almost all used buying equipment for experiments in my field.
It's said that this aroused complaints from several Academicians.
Haha - by the way, I think they seem to have been ripped off on some imported equipment.
There's one test system for measuring how airtight a room is.  In America it's very common.  I reckon you could definitely get it for 500 US dollars.  But it turns out that SEU spent 50,000 renminbi on it!!!
There's some other things, too.  A lot of colleges and departments at SEU have now moved to the new campus at Jiulong Lake, but the School of Architecture insists on staying.  It says it wants to give the students a good architectural environment.  The old campus still has some classic architecture for them to see, whereas the new campus doesn't have anything.
Haha - It seems like the School of Architecture has also requested and obtained another building because the other departments have all moved out.
So Dean Wang said straight out to me that in future he would be able to give me my own office.
I'm extremely embarrassed: when Dean Wang said this, I didn't have even the slightest reaction.
Later, Professor Zhang pulled me aside and told me that this was not easy to get, because offices were in extremely short supply.  Some of the senior professors didn't even have their own offices.
This made me feel very unsettled.  It seems I still don't, ah, understand the situation in this country.
Overall, I've had a very pleasant trip to SEU.  The senior faculty and connected lecturers at the SEU School of Architecture have shown themselves to be extremely professional and hospitable, and have made a very good impression on me.
I hope everything goes well for SEU in its development, and may the School of Architecture continue to maintain its leading position!
The Qinhuai River by the shade of lights and the splash of oars
Even the Finest Feast Must Break up at Last
Two weeks ago I had lunch with my colleagues to say goodbye to our former boss.
This boss is really worthy of the name high-flying woman.  She is extremely good to her subordinates like us, and we gladly worked for her, even doing overtime in the evenings and on weekends.  This is not common among Americans.  She can also be considered the best boss I've ever worked for.
She has left the company and started a math tutorial class for elementary school and middle school students because she wants to look after her family and have more time to teach her kids.
I'm sure she will succeed whatever she does!
Taking Her Love to Africa, Stephanie Sun Runs into a Sandstorm, Gets thrown at with a Stone, and Suffers Scratches (Pictures)
Caring for sick children.
Showing off "mouse muscles."
With World Vision, for the second time Stephanie Sun has gone on in Africa from Congo to Niger.
At a press conference yesterday, she admitted frankly that it was the most tiring journey she had ever made.
The weather in that area is scorching, the drinking water dirty, and when she visited a market she encountered people at a protest angrily throwing stones.  Even riding on a camel she was scratched by the saddle.
Throughout the journey there was mishap after mishap, making her scream to herself several times, "I really want to go home!"
Shock at seeing the children's malnutrition
Having taken part in World Vision's campaigns to care for poor children for the past three consecutive years, Stephanie Sun calls herself an experienced spokesperson.
She took 30 bottles of vitamins, 40 flashlights, and 500 sweets to share with the local children.
She said that having accumulated a lot of experience, she knew that no matter how many little gifts she took, they would never be enough.
In Niger, the most serious problem is that mothers have no understanding of the issues involved in child raising, so the children suffer from serious malnutrition.
On the eight-hour car journey from the capital of Niger to the small town of Dara 500 kilometers away, Stephanie Sun experienced a sandstorm rarely seen in the area.
The wind blew sand and brought rain, and the whole sky changed colors with the wind and clouds.
The Jeep they were riding in shook more and more in the wind.
Recalling that moment, Stephanie Sun shuddered at the memory, revealing that even though she was in the car, she was very afraid.
She only relaxed a little when she later heard local people explaining that the sandstorm was a sign of good luck, bringing rain and moisture to the soil.
With local residents.
Pained by mothers' problems raising children
When she arrived at Dara, local officials held a dromedary welcome ceremony and invited Stephanie Sun to sit on the camel and be cheered by the local people.
But the camel was scared by the flashes and got completely out of control, nearly throwing Stephanie Sun to the ground.
Finally Stephanie Sun jumped down herself, but her clothes were accidentally got ripped by a hook on the saddle which scratched her arm, leaving a small bloody streak about eight centimeters long.
On this trip, Stephanie Sun visited four sick local children with severe malnourishment.  One of them was a baby four months old, weighing just 2.1 kilograms.  It didn't look like a person at all.
She said: "When I saw him, my heart ached.  His condition was really so extreme.  But it must also be the mother's problem.  We should teach them correct ideas about nutrition."
The Key to Chinese Education - Humanize It
Key words: the key to Chinese education - humanize it, the key to Chinese education - humanize it
The goal of education is: to make the educated more able to live in and enjoy the existing social environment.
"Live" everyone can easily understand, but perhaps everyone has just understood "enjoy" as simply "have fun."  Actually, that's not right.  The scope of "enjoy" here is very broad.
Live: this includes the strengthening of the body and the strengthening of the mind.
1. Strengthening of the body: through various forms of physical %pw, increase +physical strength, improve coordination, bring about steady improvement in sporting ability, so that you can meet the need for sufficient physical exercise and the needs of engaging with society.
2. Strengthening of the mind: to be able to recognize more clearly the society in which you find yourself, to know yourself, to learn to engage with other people, to learn the ability to adapt yourself as you live and to experience and enjoy.
Above I've explained the goals of education, but the connection with this essay isn't very strong.  Now I'll talk about the key point: the key to Chinese education - humanize it
The essence of humanization is: fully understanding the differences among individuals whom you cannot treat the same.
Club Original Writing: a Few Common Stages in Learning about Buffett
Club original writing: a few common stages in learning about Buffett: I'm Strolling
1) Stage one: introduction to Buffett.  You have a feeling of finally finding what you've been looking for, and immediately apply it in real life, but at this time your understanding of Buffett's ideas is not deep, not thorough.  Very often you'll make a lot of mistakes in using them, apply them incorrectly, and apply them blindly, so the results will be patchy.
2) Stage two: "surpassing" Buffett.  After a period of learning and practice, almost every "intelligent person" is thinking about a few questions: for example, what should a Buffett with Chinese characteristics be like?
Does Buffett's theory need to be applied flexibly in China?
Can I do even better than Buffett?
So the main features of this stage are overconfidence and blind arrogance, looking for a Buffett theory with Chinese characteristics.
After a period of application, the results will generally still be patchy and inconsistent.  If your luck is good, it's better to have some losses and quickly return to the mainstream.
3) Stage three: you return to Buffett.  After a few wrong turns, you are finally able to realize that +you are an ordinary person, not a genius.
You should demand a little less of yourself.  Making a solid study of Buffett is more than enough.
The simplest turns out to be the most effective.  But the simple methods often include very deep thinking, and you must understand this thinking before you can better apply the simple through to the end.
The characteristics of this stage are results that are not substantial in the short term, but plentiful in the long term, and consistent.
Stage four: "inflexible" Buffett.  Having achieved consistent results, in this stage you are basically inflexible with regard to Buffett's theories.  You take no notice at all of companies other than Buffett's.
You go on learning and deepening your understanding of Buffett and applying it in real life.  The characteristics of this stage are ever-improving results, consistency, and entering into a virtuous spiral.
The time that each person need for each stage varies.  It depends on both your personal situation and your luck.
A Devout Buddhist (236553903) 14:18:05
He is one of my old net friends.  He posted this story in the group.
I'd rather write this story in this section.
I hope everyone reads this article.  I have no expectation that it will be the so-called top pick, but sometimes there are some things, some truths, that you can understand and learn from a pithy little story.
This is a story that makes you feel very cold when you've finished reading it.
I really hope this really is just a story... because I really do feel bad...
On a highway in the mountain three bandits with guns spotted a pretty woman driver.  They forced the mid-sized bus to stop and tried to take the woman driver off the bus for some fun.  The woman driver desperately cried for help, but all the passengers on the bus were too scared to move.
Just one scrawny middle-aged man responded and went to fight with them, but he was knocked to the ground and suffered injuries.
The man got really angry, vigorously shouting to everyone on the bus to stop the assault, but nobody responded, allowing the woman driver to be dragged into the bushes in the mountain.
Half an hour later, the three bandits returned with the woman driver, whose clothes were disheveled.
The bus was going to start again.  The woman driver told the scrawny man, who had been hurt and was bleeding, to get off the bus.
The man refused, and became argumentative.
Hey, get off the bus!  My bus won't take you.
The middle-aged man became desperate and said: Why are you being so unreasonable?  Was I wrong to try to save you?
You save me?
What did you save me from?
The woman driver flatly dismissed him, and a few passengers sniggered.
The middle-aged man got really angry, and cursed himself for not having the strength of a superhero.
But even if he hadn't succeeded in saving anyone, he didn't deserve to be turned out of the bus like this as a result.  He firmly refused to get off.
For another thing, I've bought a ticket.  I have a right to stay on the bus!
The driver turned away from him and said coldly: If you don't get off the bus, I'm not driving.
Unexpectedly, all of the passengers on the bus who had just ignored the assault seemed to have just woken up and jointly told the man to get off the bus: Quickly, get off the bus.  We've got things to do, we can't wait.
A few strong passengers even wanted to come forward and drag the middle-aged man off the bus.  It was enough to make you think of the story from "Boule de Suif" by Maupassant.
The three bandits were grinning, laughing with satisfaction.
One of them, a dark-skinned thug with no principles, said shamelessly: Us guys did everything we wanted with her!
The two other bandits also started talking trash: She's my girlfriend, it's got damn-all to do with you!
There was uproar, until the man's luggage was thrown out of the window of the bus, and then he was shoved out.
The bus once again drove steadily along the mountain road.  The woman driver arranged her hair, and turned on the recorder.
The bus had nearly reached the top of a hill.  When it had gone around this turn it would start going down.  To the left of the bus was the road blasted out of the hillside.  On the right was a cliff hundreds of feet high.
The bus quietly picked up speed.  The woman driver's face was completely composed, her two hands holding the steering wheel tightly, tears glittering in her eyes.
One of the bandits seemed to sense something and said: Slow down, slow down, what the fuck are you trying to do?
The woman driver didn't say anything, and the bus went faster and faster.
The bandit tried to run forward and grab the steering wheel, but the bus sped towards the cliff like an arrow from a bow...
The next day the local newspapers reported: A tragedy occurred yesterday in Fuhu Mountain area.  A mid-sized bus fell off a cliff.
There were no survivors among the driver and 13 passengers.
When the middle-aged man who had been thrown off the bus along the way saw the newspaper, he cried.
No-one knew what he was crying for, or why he cried.
Darkness at the Railroad Station
Recently I was away from home for a few days.  I took the train, and discovered the nastiness of railway stations everywhere during the summer high season.
I wanted to understand more about what we should be aware of at railroad stations in various places.
I'm from Changsha, so I'll first say a bit about the situation in Changsha.  Everyone should be aware of this when they come to Changsha!
1. Train tickets are always difficult to buy.  At Changsha railroad station, at every major holiday or the beginning and end of the summer and winter school vacation, you have absolutely no chance of getting a ticket.  However early you go, queuing up is useless.
The best answer I've received when I asked is that the travel agencies book up all the tickets.
But with the ticket touts, you can pay a bit extra and have as many as you want.
2. Watch out for fake tickets.  The tickets that the touts have are not necessarily real.  Shuangfeng and Xinhua in Hunan make their money, one from fake certificates and one from fake coins, so fake tickets is really just child's play!
Amending tickets is the most basic.  Some tickets look so real that even the train attendants can't tell the difference.
3. Who touched my money?  When buying things at stores at railroad stations, you absolutely must be careful!
If you want to give them small bills, haha, your bills are always missing a corner, so you have to use a large bill instead.
But when you give a large bill instead, once the store owner has got his hands on it, he will definitely say he can't change it, give it back to you and ask for those small bills with the missing corners again.  At this point all you can do is take back a fake large bill!
4. Change from a magician.  Not every store owner will swap your big bills.  That's a crime, and the risks are pretty big!
So some "cowardly" store owners have to be magicians.  You clearly see that your change is right when they count it, but when you have a chance to count it yourself, haha!  It's short by a few bills.
5. Imported drinks everywhere.  There aren't that many cafes at the railroad station, but if you go in one you'll understand.
A few glasses of rough red wine are sold at the price of Martell.  If you don't pay... then even your mother might not recognize you.
6. Roses and guns.  There are a lot of video booths around the railroad station.  The titles of the films showing are very attractive to us common men, so if you go in and watch, you'll be surely taken to be a distinguished guest who wants a little relaxation.  So a flower girl will come along straight away to keep you company.  Of course, you need to have enough money for a five-star hotel consumption, otherwise those big knives aren't always used for fighting foreign devils!
7. Ice and fire.  If you've got a Changsha accent or you know Changsha very well, then don't ever think about getting a taxi in the square in front of the railroad station.  The face on the taxi driver will make you understand what a snowstorm in June really is!
But if this is your first time in Changsha, then congratulations!  Never mind that you are going somewhere five minutes' walk away, the driver will still be glad to take you to enjoy the sights of this national-level key tourism city, and will also let you breathe a lungful of secondhand smoke from the famous White Sand brand and have a smell that it is loaded with the local specialty - betel flavoring.
Of course, you have to pay for the transport yourself, don't you?
Nanjing Metro Drivers Should Get Psychotherapy ASAP
Key word: Psychotherapy
According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, there was a suicide on the tracks in the Nanjing metro on the evening of July 3.
According to what the reporter says, "Zhu Zhengting, 22, is a young metro driver.  He had a nightmarish experience.  When this reporter saw him yesterday, he seemed not to have recovered from his horror.  He was sitting very straight up in his chair, and his eyes also looked a little glazed."
Obviously, this young driver's nerves had received a big shock, and he urgently needed to get some psychotherapy, otherwise it would affect him for the rest of his life.
I don't know if everyone remembers the emergency rescue guy who saved a little girl in an abandoned oil well in the US +state of Texas over a decade ago.  After suffering long-term psychological torture, he eventually chose to kill himself and ended his painful life.
Even though he had had basic psychotherapy at the time, people focused more on the little girl who had been rescued and overlooked precisely the one person who needed psychotherapy more.  In the end, they failed to prevent this tragedy from happening.
In the same way, in the Dover Straits illegal immigration case a few years ago, it was said that the first British policeman to open the container went into shock right there.
Afterwards the British authorities gave him over two months of psychotherapy before he got back to normal.
When people suffer a catastrophic shock, their minds are wounded very seriously.  At this time, if you rely only on your own resources it's very difficult to make a full recovery, and often psychological scars will be left.
Since these scars are very difficult for others to find, and if they do find them, there's nothing they can do, many people involved in incidents will be in pain for the rest of their lives.
However, in our country people don't care enough about psychological wounds, particularly the families or employers of the people involved often think of it only after they've missed the best window for recovery.  Then it's already too late.
Now that there is more diversity in the broadcast media, we often hear about shocking things.  A lot of young women get hurt, and a lot of young children see their own parents suffer terrible injuries.
After these young people have been rescued, we very rarely hear that they have received psychological treatment.  More often they are consoled by the love of their relatives.
Although the victims can feel that they are now safe, the past harm becomes a scar that can never be removed and can be inflamed at any time.  This affects the life of the person involved.
We can be grateful that this driver's superiors quickly calmed him down, and were able to ease his psychological stress.
Ultimately, the driver was not to blame for the accident, and the driver took measures when he discovered the situation.  He had done what he should have done, but just hadn't stopped the tragedy from happening.
I'm sure anyone there would have been shocked by the accident that happened on the scene, even if they weren't the driver involved.
But other people didn't have any connection with the suicide.  Even if they were shocked, they would gradually forget as time went by.
But the driver involved isn't that lucky.  He has to remember, and very likely will remember it all his life.
If he can free himself from this, then he's lucky.  If he can't free himself from it, then he'll often be tortured by this kind of shock.
The modern conception of health is much more comprehensive than in the past.  Psychological health is starting to be noticed by people.
The pity is that the psychological condition of humanity is very depressing.  Particularly in the cities, people's psychological health is not at all what it should be.  Many people have psychological problems to a greater or lesser extent, and some people are not able to get enough attention when they encounter problems.
Think of the lessons of the Yang Lijuan incident a while back.  Some irresponsible news outlets turned a sick person tormented by psychological problems into the subject of media hype, causing very bad impact on our society.
In the future we should avoid this kind of thing happening, otherwise our society really will turn into a sick society.
Five Teachers at Dongkou No. 5 Middle School Feel Overwhelmed after the First Period of Training in the New Syllabus
Key Words: Dongkou No. 5 Middle School, teacher's first period, new syllabus %pw   Five teachers from Dongkou No. 5 Middle School Feel Overwhelmed after the First Period of Training in the New Syllabus  From the morning of July 13 to the 15th, the first group of teachers from Dongkou No. 5 Middle School to take the training for the new syllabus got a real taste of the pressure and the motivation from the new syllabus.
At the same time, they also feel that the syllabus reform is a rare opportunity and challenge for the development of teaching at the school.
On the morning of the 13th, because roadwork on the stretch of road from Shijiang in Dongkou to Longhui had caused a traffic jam, it was already past 1:00 p.m. by the time the teachers from Dongkou No. 5 Middle School and teachers from Suining and other places made it to the municipal education bureau.  The staff at the education bureau, who had long worked beyond their midday break, %pw still got the training materials that they had loaded into cars out of the cars again and did the necessary paperwork for us, and we got our training materials.
At 2.30 p.m., the travel-weary teachers again braved the scorching heat and separately entered the multimedia classrooms at Municipal No. 1 Middle School, Municipal No. 2 Middle School and Municipal No. 6 Middle School to listen to lectures by the relevant experts.
Over the next two days, the teachers listened to lectures by the editors of the teaching materials or listened to lessons learned from the experiences of teachers in provinces which had already started the new syllabus reform.  Some of the educational researchers or teachers who had attended province-level training in the new syllabus also talked about their experiences and what they had learned.
On the morning of the 15th, after finishing all of the training courses, we then went through assessment.  The five teachers from Dongkou No. 5 Middle School had studied hard and never came in late or left earlier, so they passed the assessment easily, and all received a certificate of course completion.
During the training period, the Dongkou No. 5 Middle School teachers talked among themselves.  At first we all felt that the new syllabus was rather unfamiliar, that this was a difficult task, that there was a lot of pressure, and that it was difficult to understand.
But after the training was finished, everyone thought that this was also an opportunity and a challenge.
We are all determined to work at adjusting the structure of our knowledge and complete the task of syllabus reform as satisfactorily as possible.
The second group of teachers to attend the new syllabus training arrived at the relevant location for training on the 16th.
Dongkou No. 5 Middle School Holds Meeting on New Syllabus Training, Makes Arrangements for Going to the Municipal Education Bureau to Attend Syllabus Reform Training
Key Words: Dongkou No. 5 Middle School holds meeting on new syllabus training, %pw
Dongkou No. 5 Middle School Holds Meeting on New Syllabus Training, Makes Arrangements for Going to the Municipal Education Bureau to Attend Syllabus Reform Training  At 12:00 noon on July 5, the school held a meeting in the principal's office for the teachers attending training in the new syllabus during the summer vacation.
Principal Xie conveyed the gist of the meeting he had attended in the county on training in the new syllabus, and described the significance of the new syllabus reform.  In addition he made specific arrangements concerning the people attending the training, time, costs, important issues and other things.
According to the briefing, attending Shaoyang Municipality new syllabus reform training meetings this time will be principals, directors of teaching and teachers teaching first-year senior high school students next year.
The funds would be allocated by upper authorities.  It's said they are being covered by Xinhua Bookstore.
First is general training for principals and directors of teaching, and then there is training for teachers by subject.  The teacher training is divided into three periods.  For the first period (Chinese, chemistry, history, biology) you report on the morning of July 13 in the lobby on the first floor of the municipal education bureau.  You have to bring your ID card, and you will receive the relevant allowance.
Afterwards, you have classes every morning at about 8:00, and have classes in the afternoon at 2.30.
The actual training time is two days, until the morning of the 15th.
In this time there will also be a test, and those who pass will be issued a certificate of course completion.
The history class will be held at Shaoyang Municipal No. 1 Middle School.
After you return, the school will also reimburse 60 yuan in tuition and transport costs.  You will not enjoy business travel or other allowances.
Happy to Make Friends with Fans of Celebrities
Key Words: fans of celebrities
I have a female friend whom I've never seen.
I said straight out to her, I really admire you!
Because you express your love candidly.
She likes a male host of a popular entertainment program in Taiwan, and has never hidden her feelings.
When this male host hosts a program in Jinan, she flies to Jinan; when this male host goes to Changsha to do a guest appearance, she flies to Changsha.
The male host says in his book that a friend gave him a slingshot with no shot.  Pleasantly surprised, she told me, "I gave him that slingshot."
She also helps to do an online magazine about this star.  Every issue she excitedly reads it with me.
I've always really liked talking with some people who frankly admit that they are a fan of such-and-such a celebrity.
These celebrities can be movie stars, can be sports stars, and of course can also be great figures.
I've never thought that these friends are shallow.  I think they're very lovely.
These people are usually straightforward people.  If they like someone, they like someone, if they don't like someone, they don't like them.
Getting along with this kind of people can be very easy.
Although they won't think 100% about your feelings, you at least know what makes them tick.  You also know that you will feel more secure if you spend time with them.
These people are also very honest.
You should know that it also takes courage to dare to express your likings.
It's precisely because of this that a lot of people just secretly like a person their entire life, or they might even look down a little on those people who barefacedly say they are a fan of so-and-so.
I think honesty is a person's greatest strong point, being honest with friends and being honest with yourself.
But it is actually very hard to do that.
If one can love a celebrity, it also proves that a part of his heart is selfless.
Some of my friends are fans of celebrities.
Sometimes they can go through a lot of hardship to get a look at this celebrity.  They can sacrifice many things, tighten their belts and scrimp and save, holding a placard in their left hand and pressing a camera button with their right, while shouting on and on.
You could say they are very silly or childish, but it takes selflessness to love someone without looking for anything in return.
Because in reality, there are far too many who love themselves, think they're great, and think little of other people.  So this bit of selflessness seems to be quite precious.
So when everyone starts chatting and saying that the celebrity they like is so-and-so, if someone says, I've never made anyone my idol...
Haha, then you should watch out.
Teresa Cheung the Person
Key words: Teresa Cheung
By chance I had an opportunity to see an episode of "Kangxi Come" that I hadn't seen for a long time.  The main guest was Teresa Cheung.
Thinking back, it was when she was promoting "Color Blossoms."
The time when I saw "Colour Blossoms" was the days when I was mad about erotic movies.
At the time I thought it was extraordinary that sex movies could be filmed in such an esthetic way.  Sometimes they were also really interesting and were called erotic movies.
Actually, I haven't seen many erotic movies, but they cover quite a lot of countries.
The first ones I saw were from Korea and Japan.
Later I also saw quite a lot from third world countries and some from Latin America and Europe.  But I didn't see many Hollywood or French movies.
I couldn't bear to delete two of them from my computer.  One is "Plum Blossom," and the other is just "Color Blossoms."
The first half of "Color Blossoms" is quite good.  They are all first-timers and act very energetically.  The direction is also very measured.
Then in the second half it's a bit perverted, I can't take it at all.
Actually, what I want to say is that Teresa Cheung said on the program that her boyfriends have included those of almost every nationality in the world, except for Africans.
At present, she has four boyfriends.
On this issue, I'm afraid the average person would find it unacceptable and would say this person is a slut.
But the key point in this issue is that she was very honest when she was talking about these issues.  There wasn't a hint of an expression that would make people uncomfortable.
She also talked about her view of love.
For example, both parties should keep their money separate.
I guess their identities should also be independent.  Each one controls their own fate.
Because I know that for people who are in love, love is alive, is selfish.  How could it allow the person you love to accept the love of another person at the same time?
Going by my experience and guesswork, most likely Teresa Cheung's love is no longer a simple entanglement.  She must be going for the classic relationship with a younger man.
In a relationship with a younger man, the older woman can accommodate anything, including having several toyboys at the same time.  At the same time, the younger man can attach himself without reservation to the older woman because of her attractiveness and maternal nature, but maybe doesn't mind whether he is the only one, etc., etc.
But I also felt from what Teresa Cheung said that she is someone who really knows how to enjoy life.
For example, she is +crazily passionate about travel.
So I also have reason to believe that her life is also very exciting.
If it was the past me, I'm afraid I would still not be able to accept this kind of thing.
Just like now, I've come to accept a lot of people.  Actually, this hasn't got that much to do with tolerance or intolerance, it's just about thinking it over in your own mind, then there are no absolute loves or hates.
These people, like passer-by A, friend B, Zhang Ziyi, good friend C, and Sister Lotus.
Looking at other people's lives, I am an onlooker, so to other people, mustn't I also be the main character in my own life?
It's just like, even though I'm not in Jianghu, there are always stories about me in Jianghu.
People Always Need a Spice of Entertainment
Key words: spice of entertainment
For people, life is a tiring thing, so it's best if we have a spice of entertainment.
Either laughing at ourselves or watching jokes from the people around us, gossiping about other people.
For example, just going to the Tianya "Celebrity Gossip" board for a bit of relaxation.
In there, everyone says whatever they want, but you should of course have a bit of ability to distinguish between right and wrong, because there's all kinds of "trickery."
The results of "say what you want" are that you don't even know what you're saying yourself, but you want to be clear what it is you're reading.
Little S calls Tsai Kang-yung a "scholar."
If I also count as one, then it's the kind who has read some books, but hasn't yet really grasped them.
At least I always know my own shortcomings.
But, the +good thing is that I got a few things that I myself wanted to get when I did this bit of reading.
It also happens that I like just pondering over things, too.  So I was pondering and reading at the same time, but I got quite a few ideas clear.  A lot of things clicked into place.
So, gradually I got into some habits, like telling myself to be a bit harder on myself and a bit better to other people.
When running into a problem with some matter, first look for the cause in yourself.
Use your head in the way you do things and follow your heart in dealing with relationships.
Keep a low profile and do things in a low key.
But, you know, not all people are that nice.  They'll always be selfish, and always think about their own gains and losses.  There'll always be times when they should be using their heads, but they follow their hearts into a big mess, and times when they should be following their hearts, but they're still using f**king logic like there's no tomorrow.
But at least there is a good side: I never regret the choices I've made.
If I've done it then I've done it; if I've messed up, then I live with it.
What's the point in thinking about all that useless stuff?
At least I'm not one of those people who likes to be all po-faced and puff myself up as a scholar.  I'm just an ordinary person, too.
Where I'm different from other people is just that I don't have to be cynical.  I'm a bit more reasonable in dealing with matters in general.
Or, for example, my trust is particularly strong.
Once I trust someone, then I'll think that everything about him is good.
Even if there are shortcomings, I'm still perfectly happy to forgive them.
Even though I'm not the type of person to call people friends readily, I'm the kind who thinks about his friends and puts himself in their shoes.
But I'm also therefore pretty strict in choosing my friends.
I also don't understand at all why there are still so many people today who trust so much everything the newspapers say.
Or is it that in their minds, today's reports are still sacred like those of the past?
But then, in this world, there are still a lot of things that I don't understand.
Jokes.
Giving myself a slap on the face.
Song Dandan's "The Secrets of Happiness," Warm and Moving
Key words: Song Dandan, The Secrets of Happiness
A while ago, I read in the newspaper that Song Dandan had published a new book called "The Secrets of Happiness."
I really wanted to read it.
Because I thought that as a woman of this age, with this kind of profession, she had experienced changes in her family and in her career.  Having gone through these, what are her views on herself and on life?
As expected, I was not disappointed.  After I read it, I had two feelings.  First, I got an electric shock: looking at someone else's life, you can see the image of your own life just the same.  Second, I was also very much moved.  It was full of things like the details of her love for her family.
Why did I get an electric shock?
In the book, Song Dandan writes, "I missed an important principle in life: One is happier to give than to receive.
I was always busy giving, busy making myself happy.
I never received, and never understood how to.  I neglected to allow other people to give, which is to say, I neglected other people's right to make themselves happy."
I find that I've also been always enjoying this kind of happiness.  In the future perhaps I should be a bit more careful.
It requires a certain amount of courage for a person to look steadily on their own past, and lay it all out in front of everyone.
In here she includes her first love, her failed marriage with Ying Da and her deep dissection of herself and her love for her son.
This book has another praiseworthy aspect, because at first the publisher must have given her a lot of pressure to focus more on cases like "I Love My Family," "House of the Flying Daggers" and the series of sketches with Zhao Benshan.
But she probably stood her ground.  She only mentions Zhao Benshan a bit at the end, and as for "House of the Flying Daggers" and "I Love My Family," she hardly mentions them.
The whole book is full of the warm and moving reflections of a 40-year-old woman on life, on love, on family, and on love for the family.
Busy Vacation
Key words: vacation, busy
I've been on vacation for nearly a week, but I haven't had any time at all to relax.
I went to the college for a meeting, and I have to prepare the materials for going on a trip next week for a conference, and a speech for the conference.
This vacation will be very busy.
Barring accidents, according to my schedule I have three conferences to attend and four or five cities to go to.
My life has suddenly been filled up with many things: the same things, different things.  I've almost forgotten how I used to spend the vacations before.
It seems that in my memory, I still didn't have much relaxation time.
It's just that before I still had long periods of time that I could arrange myself, but this year it seems like there's less time.
Is this a good thing?  Or a bad thing?
Being busy, you feel a bit more substantial, but if there's no results or no gains for your busy work, then there is much less point to being busy.
But sometimes it seems that life can't be completely measured in terms of results.  Life is to be gradually experienced.  Solidity and stability, substance and pleasure are also a kind of gains, even though sometimes this gain can't be measured using society's appraisal standards.
Every person needs confirmation from society's values and their own values.  If we can't get both, what do we do?
Marxism teaches us that we should take the values of society as primary, and proposes that individuals should contribute to society.  But in reality, a healthy, wholesome society should also fully respect an individual's wishes and value choices, and should create the conditions in which personal values can be realized.
As all this occurred to my mind all of a sudden, I'm discovering more and more that Marxist principles really are very effective.
The truth really is like this, but when it actually comes to real life, people often find they are still bound to feel confused.
Even if the realization of personal values doesn't interfere with society's values, will each one of us practical individuals be content with the realization of our own real values so much that we ignore the judgment of society?
Or can the satisfaction with our own values be separated from the judgment of society?
I'd say it's very difficult.
So each of us is bound to pursue the extraordinary and beyond, even as we are working to be a good ordinary person.  And if we waste our lives, we also will always blame ourselves.
This could be said to be one side of socialized man.
Being on vacation I still feel more or less a bit relaxed.
At least, I have time to watch some DVDs, and I can relax myself and have fun for a while.
I can say what I want, but I still have to work, and life goes on just the same.
Next week I have to go to Xi'an again for a conference.
It's a city that I've never been to, but that I don't seem to much like, because of some "prejudices."
I hope that this trip can change my impression of the city, haha.
"Having a Very Feminist Life"
Key words: men, feminism, era
This afternoon, Ying called me.  We chatted for a while, and then my watching "Happy Boys" came up.
Ying said: "No way!  You are too cute.  You finish watching Supergirls and then watch Happy Boys.  You're just a dedicated viewer of Hunan Satellite TV."
I said that was true.
Ying said she had seen some of the selection programs for the boys, and thought they were all girly boys.  I also thought the same, but I told her that the top four contestants had been selected from the five on Happy Boys.  Next week three will be selected from the four.  They were singing really well, each of them was excellent.
Ying, who studies popular culture and consumer culture, also said excitedly that she would have a look too next week.  After all, we had got to the most critical stage of the competition, and it would definitely be worth watching.  And taking an interest in this would also be good for stocking up on some examples for future research.
Then we started talking again about how this is an era of male beauty.
Men have finally turned from "spectators" into "the spectated," whereas, women, who had previously been the object, have become the subject.  They can appreciate and face various male talent shows in this era of male beauty from the perspective of the observer.
Ying said this was women's liberation, a sign of feminism.
Then next she said, "Don't you think you are now having a very feminist life?"
When I heard what Ying said, I was so amused that I laughed out loud.
This remark itself is filled with the meaning of feminism, it's just that I don't have a good  capacity for analysis like Ying's that can explain all these things more deeply and clearly.
I like Chen Chusheng's singing on Happy Boys very much.  It's got a very special texture, a power to pierce space and time right to your heart; it's very pure and very comforting.
Su Xing sings in many different styles, and is full of feeling.  He looks handsome and cultured, but he gives you a lively, relaxed feeling.
Zhang Jie sings with great clarity and power, and particularly the two songs he nailed today, "The Way You Look" and "Past Goes with the Wind," are both old songs that I like very much, they left a deep impression.
Wei Chen has a cute, innocent face that extremely resembles Lu Yi's.  It's said that he attracts a lot of girls, and of course his voice isn't bad.
The next clash between these four strong competitors should be very good to watch.
I'm looking forward to watching their great performances next week.
Random Thoughts on Kimchi, June 29
Key words: kimchi, Seoul
Random Thoughts on Kimchi, June 29  I switched on international roaming, but when I got off the plane, my cell phone seemed to have had its power cut.  It still didn't have even one bar of signal.  Maybe GSM's effective coverage means the scope of the "heart," and it will be effective from the next billing date.
These few days, I'm going to lose contact with everyone temporarily.  Haha, will there be anyone who worries about me because of this?
I've turned on their Secretary System, just want to be sure who's missing me.
It doesn't matter if it's business or personal.
But the question is, who am I hoping will miss me?
My heart has turned completely blank again.  I don't know when it started.
I don't understand why there are always some people that you want to keep hold of but can't, and some people that you don't want to keep hold of but who always think that they can squeeze themselves in.  Is it like when you're talking about markets?
But can I always let the "white gloves" block up my heart, no matter whether or not there is a place for you?
But substance and heart cannot be talked about as if they were the same after all!
Our car is driving along the expressway to Busan.
Our department head is driving silently, and I don't have anything to say.
Anyway, he doesn't understand Chinese and doesn't understand English, either, and me, I can only speak a very few very awkward sentences of English.
I'm looking at the computer, rather bored, punching the keyboard.  In the car, apart from the sound of the keyboard, there's only the pleasant voice of a Korean girl giving directions on the GPRS.  Everything is too -- rather silent.
Outside the window, all that's left to see is never-ending green and a grey-blue sky.
Silence is unusual for my personality.
What I hadn't expected is that the only thing in this country that gives me a sense of fellow feeling is actually English.
Apart from making me dizzy like from radiation, those little circles I see everywhere have no other function at all.
I think South Korea definitely will not produce compasses.
Because there's no demand in the market.
Seoul is very clean, thoroughly clean, unfailingly clean.
It's just a pity that in the few days I am in Seoul, I won't have time to go anywhere but my workplace and the department store.  My entire impression is limited to what I see along the streets.
Luckily, everything was still very good!
Koreans are polite in a traditional way.  They smile meticulously, listen carefully.  They're elegant and quiet.
Everything I've been able to notice is the beautiful surface: traditional customs, ancient architectural styles, and absolutely scrupulous courtesy.
Is this hypocritical?
Then it's better to be a bit hypocritical, at least everyone is polite!
If you don't see the ugly things, maybe you'll think they don't exist.
Korean cuisine is really amazing!
It's just that I don't like it.  I don't understand why they suffer themselves going back and forth, when it's only kimchi in various forms and on an assortment platter.  Of course, there must be seaweed.
Then, thinking again about it, the amount that Korean people know about their cuisine is still very awesome.  They can tell the difference between kimchi that's been pickled above ground and underground or for different lengths of time, and with up to minute precision.
This shows, from one perspective, that the seriousness of Koreans might have something to do with the kimchi served from morning till night.
My only headache is that I don't know what kind of recipe with kimchi again somehow integrated will it have at the Japanese tofu restaurant that the head of department is going to take us to.
Thinking of the Chinese food last night, I feel like I want to cry.  It was completely Koreanized.  The only thing I could eat turned out to be kimchi.
A-ha, thanks to China Southern Airlines Co. and the kimchi it offers together with its in-flight meals.
The airline must think that I want to start getting used to it from the moment I get on the plane.
Two more days before I will go back to my country.  If there still isn't anyone to miss, then I can still miss a meal of Auntie's braised pork!
After all, satisfaction for the stomach comes a bit more directly than for the heart.
Of course, it has nothing at all to do with kimchi.
Two Trees
Two trees: one is me, one was my brother-in-law.
We gave each other shade, and looked after each other.
In my generation they all have a lot of children, but I only have sisters, no brothers.  So the presence of my brother-in-law seemed extremely important.
We both come from poor backgrounds.  We had to take part in doing a lot of domestic chores when we were very small.  Even though I always worked hard to act like a man and wanted to do my work like an expert, I never ever got my father's' approval.
Ever since I was small, I've suffered from sleepwalking, but it wasn't too serious.  But when I was doing work around the house, it's hard to stop my mind wandering.
For example, my father told me to put some plaster on the chimney at our old house.  I nimbly climbed up onto the roof to do it.
The chimney got plastered OK, but when it rained, water leaked into the room.  The reason was that I had trodden on and broken the roof tiles.
Another example, my father told me to change a light bulb, one of those old-fashioned incandescent bulbs.
When I'd climbed onto the stool, the light bulb in my hand slipped from my hand, fell onto the concrete and smashed.
I've got countless examples like this, so when my brother-in-law came to live with us, he naturally took over these various little jobs, and did them really beautifully and with no need to pay any labor cost.
And I gleefully hid in a corner reading light novels thick as bricks.
Later we grew up into two trees, two trees big enough to support the home of a family.
And my father could not stop himself shrinking.  Sitting in a wheelchair, he became a quiet bush in the leafy shade.
No-one expected that things suddenly changed: at 50, my brother-in-law suddenly contracted a serious illness.  That great tree, so vital and bushy on the surface, came so close to that terrifying death in a way that was hard to believe.
On that summer's day, the sunlight bright enough to knock you out, the doctor outside the operating room at Peking Union Medical College Hospital said casually: it's not worth operating.
He can survive another two months at the most.
At that moment it was like I'd been hit by a stray bullet.  My spirit left my body for an instant, and I stood there blankly like an idiot.
I started sleepwalking again.  I saw the old courtyard in our home, and the shadow of my young brother-in-law busy in the courtyard.
It was the shrill sound of my elder sister's crying that woke me up.  I hastily ran to hug my sister, who slumped into sitting on the floor of the hospital corridor, and as we hugged the tears were streaming down our faces.
The bright sunshine suddenly disappeared, and wave after wave of blackness appeared in front of me.
After we came back from Beijing to our city here, my brother-in-law very quickly found out what his condition was.  After he and my sister cried together for a while, his mood lightened instead.
My brother-in-law started to methodically arrange for what would happen after his death.  For example, he told his son: look after your grandmother for me.  When the old lady dies, she wants to be buried in the same grave as your grandfather; and how to open the grave when the remains are put together.
Go and see your maternal grandfather often, and buy him some useful things when it's the New Year or holidays.
For example, he told my younger sister: when I'm gone, you should often come and see your sister, she is sure to be extremely lonely on her own.
I took as much time as I could to go and see him, but when he saw me his expression was one of shame.
We often had nothing to say, just as two plants that have life but have no ability to converse.
These are two adult trees.  Experience of wind and rain has made us able to face hardship calmly.  Do you need to pass anything more on to me?
It seemed there was no need.
Because in your heart you know: after you've gone, my sister, the children you and my sister had, and this big family can only rely on the tree that is me to support them alone.
No-one forced me to be a man.
Being a man, whether you want to or not, you must brace your back without hesitation and take up the burden.
The only pity is: why did your tree have to wither so very early?  You should have had a full and flourishing old age.
The day you went was the first day of the new year.
Just at the time when all the Chinese people in the world were rejoicing and welcoming the new spring, you left, alone.
Perhaps in another space and time, another living baby sprout has just been born?
X Minutes of My Life
The reason for such a trendy-looking title is that at that moment of extreme desperation, my racing brain had no chance to take note of the time.
Like an innocent person who receives a death penalty judgment out of the blue - would he still calmly and leisurely pick over the grammatical errors in the "Verdict?"
It was a winter's day, and it was very cold in the youth center.
And I don't know whose duty day it was, but the heater hadn't been fired up for a day.
Because there was word of a strong earthquake, when we went home in the evening, we were also reluctant to restart the fire.
On the long plank-bed that could sleep 12 people, we four wrapped ourselves in cotton-padded quilts and while shivering, played a poker game of "three-on-one" under the dim lamplight to win food coupons.
Suddenly a noise thundered towards us from afar.  We few looked at one another for just an instant, then immediately realized that a disaster had struck.
Then we threw down the cards in our hands, flew down to the floor and through the two narrow doorways, scrambled to get out.
Just at the moment that we ran out of the dormitory, the poor thatched dwelling built with stones disintegrated in an instant.
We had rushed out into the yard, and it was like we were standing on a pitching and rolling boat.  We fell back and forth Like Weebles and couldn't anchor ourselves.
Within a few seconds, all of the buildings around us, +unlike the sedate images of days past, let out a strange "jiaah" noise one after another as they danced a half-crazed break dance before collapsing on themselves in a puff of smoke and dust.
The power cables above our heads naturally couldn't bear being the odd ones out, and snapped "crack crack," then fled like whips in all directions.
Meanwhile, in front of us and behind us, the rampaging quake demon was setting off ceremonial fireworks to celebrate his own creation.  The spectacular earthquake lights could rival the stage effects in any major war movie, and the rumbling sound of the earth was like war drums urging on the fighting.  They tortured every weakened nerve.
At that time we only had one idea: the human race's last day had come!
I could imagine it: the earth under our feet would open up with a crash, and boiling lava like molten steel would issue its flaming invitation, and humans, like bugs, would be cast in free-fall into the lava one after another.  Too stingy to give off a whiff of blue smoke, they would vanish in an instant.
My spine felt comfortably numb, as though it had been injected with freezing water.  In the ashy darkness the faces of my companions floated unsteadily like paper masks.
I was thinking: is this how humanity bids farewell to this wonderful world?  Will tens of thousands of years of civilization vanish without a trace now?
But I wasn't yet 20 years old!  The blossom of my youth had only just started to bloom, and I had only just perceived the joy of existence.  I was so unwilling to leave beautiful life!
And my parents, my family?  Where are you?  What are you now doing?  Are you still living in this world?
At the moment when I faced the savage grinning face of death, I missed you so much!
...In my confusion, I don't know how long it was before I finally realized with joy that the sound of the earthquake was getting quieter little by little, the shaking of the earth was slowing little by little, and the fireworks were also no longer sparkling above my head.
A tanker, tossing on stormy seas, finally slowly sailed into a calm harbor.
A young and easily breakable heart was carefully returned to its original state after going through a manic ransacking.
Oh, Earth, my home, you've finally allowed us to feel again a home's warmth and closeness!
A feeling of survivor's luck ran slowly like warm water from beneath my feet through my whole body.
When Yu Doudou, who had just turned 17, could stand steadily, she faced the yard of the youth center that had once been calm and warm, but now was all broken-down ruins, and suddenly started sobbing loudly.
Everyone was infected, and hot tears flowed everywhere.
Snow started to fall from the sky.  Was it a lament floating down for the misfortunes of humanity?
That year, the Haicheng earthquake claimed the lives of as many as 1,000 people.
An expert said: It's lucky the forecasts came in time, and that it happened before people had gone to bed, otherwise the strong earthquake, measuring 7.3, would have claimed the lives of at least 100,000 people!
Only a year later, the Tangshan earthquake erupted, and more than 200,000 people died.
The Things That Go on in the Village
There are many households in the village.  Of them all, the members of a family called South are the most disliked.  In the village there's a common saying that goes: guard against fire, guard against robbery, and guard against the Souths.
Actually, the South family are pretty honest.
Some people steal a melon or something from someone else's land at any time.  And the South family are just committing some petty theft at the worst and do not deserve to be isolated by the whole village.
No-one has clean hands, so who have we Souths offended?
The Souths started to organize some very worthy activities, showing that this village was first established by the ancestors of the South family, that the Souths had always been a major rice-growing family, and that they had produced quite a number of famous people in history.  In addition, they had made a great contribution to improving the village.
At that same time, the Souths warmly invited the village cadres to their home to have a look and sit for a while.
In all, the South family are very aspiring and proactive, striving to be powerful.
Not long ago, the West family did something very disgraceful.  They damaged the Souths' young crops very badly.
The family called West are known throughout the village for matchmaking.  All of the young guys in the village have something to thank the Wests for.
If it weren't for the good matchmaking of the Wests, how would each of you families and households be able to take good care of production?
But this time, the Wests bashed down the Souths' young crops with illegal bricks in a place called Hongdong.  It was truly terrible, and the whole village was furious.  They all said that there are no good people in the West family.
The Souths demanded an explanation from the Wests, attracting the sympathy of everyone in the village.
Everyone in the village poured abuse on the Wests.
Thus, the battlefield shifted to the West's house.
The Souths were determined to project a good image before the 17th village meeting, to make the South family, which is most populous and thriving, developed.
Even though the cadres in the village urge everyone to get along harmoniously with one another every day, this village named China is never peaceful.
The most annoying thing is, in just three short months, even the pigs have started oinking crazily and stirring up trouble.  They want to raise their price!
Two years ago, the chickens in every village were squawking about catching a cold.  Didn't they all get killed?
Pigs, why don't you think?
If you talk about calling for a revolution again, you'll have no way of avoiding the chop!
Meanwhile, the America Village and Britain Village that are used to bullying people don't seem peaceable either even though they are wealthy.
There are a few vagabonds who knocked down the tall building in America Village today and will throw some exploding pots in the metro in Britain Village tomorrow.  It's enough to make anyone frightened, isn't it?
Because of this, most people in China Village think that even though it is terrible not to be able to afford a place to stay, not to be able to afford to go to the doctor and not to be able to afford to go to school, if they can peacefully farm some land, do some jobs, make a few connections, then they have already entered a new era.
The Souths, the Wests - what family hasn't got skeletons in its cupboard?
Just take the Wan family, who live in a little +bay to the southeast of the village.  Even though the head of that household is a bit shameless, isn't our great China Village willing to take this family in all the same?
Looking to the 2008 Inter-Village Sports Contest that will be held in our China Village, let's have less of the bad things that have happened in the village, and let's deal with the bad kids in the village.
Every family, every household, light the lamps and stoke the fires.  If you have money, give money; if you can work, then work.
When the time comes, everyone goes to the village common to see a golden egg laid in the bird's nest!
(Offscreen, fading out: A golden egg or a silver egg?  To all our viewers, to all our viewers, I'm your host on Village TV, Brother Yong...)
Eric looks at Google (Google) China
Key words: Eric, Google, Google, China  Poster: an ordinary Google (Google) employee
I'm an employee who joined Google China relatively early.  In the last two years, we've gone through a lot of challenges.  Some we had predicted when they arrived; others really were beyond what we had imagined at the time.
Yesterday, I heard that in this quarter's financial report the company had a section talking specially about China's development, and I happened to hear Eric reply to a question about China.  This gave me a lot to think about, so I'm translating it as encouragement for everyone.
This remark was made by Google (Google) CEO Eric when he was replying to a question by a reporter during the Google Inc. Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call (Google Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call) (http://investor.google.com/earnings.html), saying that he is absolutely satisfied with the results that Google China has achieved so far, and that he is full of confidence about Google's prospects for development in the Chinese market.
Eric says that in China we have top-quality people, ever-improving facilities, and constantly enriched localized product lines.
He thinks that even though Google's success is not yet necessarily visible, as far as Google China is concerned, it's been an excellent beginning, and that with hard work from the China team, support from headquarters, and a dauntless spirit, he firmly believes that in the future Google will achieve astonishing success in China.
That's true.  What's important is that we keep forging onwards and upwards.  Because we grew up here, we have deep feelings for this place, and we deeply believe that Google should give China more, more; that it should give its users more, more.

Strapless Flip-Flops
It's the fashion to do everything top-less now, especially in summer.  Everyone is itching to just go running naked, because any clothing will make you feel hotter.
You maybe already knew that T-backs, which have been fashionable for many years, have been defeated by G-strings, because the latter doesn't have any straps at all.
So in an age like this, the flip-flops you're wearing on your feet may now be behind the times, because now an all-new kind of strapless flip-flop has appeared.  It's only got a sole.
How do you wear it if it's got no straps?
We're not gods, and the manufacturer can't do magic.
This flip-flop... sticks directly to the sole of your foot.  This is no spoof product, this is a real item in the shops.  The price is about 13.5 US dollars a pair.
This is another "I've imagined it existing, but never imagined that it really did exist" product.  It leaves me dumbfounded.
The manufacturer thinks this kind of flip-flop is amazingly cool.  Don't believe me?
Please look at: The soles of my feet feel uncomfortable just looking at them. [via F.C]
Beauties Everywhere, in Every Pose Imaginable @ Chinajoy from Engadget
Key word: beauties
The China Digital Entertainment Expo & Conference (Chinajoy) had its grand opening on July 12, and the average number of visitors each day has been around 40,000.
There are huge numbers of participating domestic companies at the expo this time, and most of them are presenting online games.
I'm sure that at Engadget, with its mature readership, everyone will have more interest in the showgirls than online games.
Don't get restless: the main course is coming right up.

Lenovo about to Bring out High-end ThinkPad T61p
Key words: Lenovo, ThinkPad
The ThinkPad T61p, which Lenovo will release on July 17 (US time), will also be the highest-spec T series notebook computer, and it has given us a rather nice surprise: UWB (Wisair Ultra Wideband).
That's right, just like the R400 notebook computer, linked to a high-speed transmission wireless expansion slot.
(via) This 15.4 inch notebook computer features the Santa Rosa processor and Nvidia Quadro FX 570M graphics chipsets, and of course the protective element of the T61's toughened metal rollcage for sure.  But the price is cheaper than expected: only asking for about 15,000 renminbi.
Watching Big Movies without a Screen, Pictures Released of Cell Phone Projector
Key words: Cell phone
Korean company Iljin Display has brought out a laser projector module no bigger than a coin.
Because the module is so small in size, this kind of projector module could even be installed in a cell phone.  On a wall, you can see a projection seven inches in size.
(via) Traditional projectors include three different LCD screens, each responsible for outputting a different video signal: red, green and blue.  But this mini-projector can switch among the three colors by using only a single LCD screen.  This way it has cut the size and production costs of the projector.
An official statement says that the LCD screen in this projector is only 0.24 inches in size, and could very easily be integrated into a cell phone.
Currently more than half of the cell phones on the market include a camera, and it is estimated that cell phones with internal projectors will soon appear on the market.  But whether the market will embrace them is really very difficult to say.

I also can make you satisfied.
I come to my classmate's home after a quarrel with my family.
You should know that you are not a chinese, so you have done enough to make it like this.
Only us staffs didn't have a lunch.
Do you have something else to do?

The time makes hair grey and leaves wrinkles.
Take a photo for me. Is the birthday party interesting?
My classmate said the shopkeeper had gone to Heilongjiang.
Don't consider it always.
If you do bad things to me, I won't talk to you.
If there is spare time we could think well how should we do.
Don't care about the weather. Foreigners always like girls with bronze skin.
How is everything going recenly?
You are really seriously ill...

But I am not very beautiful.
Is this store the one Luchao take us to last time to cut hair and get a massage?

It's ok to me if you want to choose another time.
You need to make friends, don't you?
I have just got to my house.
Hi friend, have you paid the rent?
The kid is too young so he needs to be cared for.
Is there any more plan?
What is your purpose?
Now every day appears like a year in length.

Many people have said that I like staying alone at home. Who can tell me why I am like that? Why don't I like to go out? Don't call me for going to another place. I just want to lie on the bed peacefully.

Then it will be more than 2100 yuan.
Why don't you have pictures?
Yes, I am a little stupid. In the past, my boyfriend from a foreign country tought me but I didn't learn it well. So my money will be spended in vain if I pay for it but can't learn it well.
I am not very good. I got sick before two days.
By the way, when will you change the screen for me?
I have to work today so I can't find a spare time to come. So sorry!
It's ok that you make a decision as you like.

You send me one to see.
I'm full.
I'm home.
I'm lost.
Of course.
What's up?
I doubt it.
I think so.
Keep it up.
Let me see.
Never mind.
No problem.
That's all.
Time is up.
What's new?
Count me on.
Don't worry.
Feel better?
Is it yours?
Do I have to?
He is my age.
Take it easy.
What a pity.
Anything else?
Do me a favor?
Help yourself.

Enjoy yourself.
Give me a hand.
How's it going?

I'll see to it.
I'm in a hurry.
It's up to you.
You owe me one.
You're welcome.
Any day will do.
I can't help it.
What time is it?
Control yourself.
I have no choice.
I'll try my best.
You asked for it.
You have my word.
Believe it or not.
Don't count on me.
Don't fall for it.
Don't let me down.
I beg your pardon.
I'll be back soon.
It's a long story.
Just wait and see.
What day is today?
Who told you that?
You can't miss it.
Don't give me that.
I can't follow you.
It's going too far.
She had a bad cold.
As soon as possible.
He always talk big.
I'll be right there.
Time is running out.
You did fairly well.
Don't lose your head.
He can't take a joke.
I know all about it.
It really takes time.
It's against the law.
You are just in time.
Fasten your seat belt.
How much does it cost?
I could hardly speak.
Make yourself at home.
None of your business.
He is collecting money.
It's unfair.
Don't waste my time anymore.
Don 't push me.
That's the stupidest thing I have ever heard.
I'm telling you for the last time.
You have ruined everything.
Don 't give me your attitude.
You 'll be sorry.
Look at the mess you have made.
Get away from me.
I'll never forgive you.
I wish I had never met you.
I'm not going to put up with this.
I'm about to explode.
Why on earth did not you tell me the truth?
You're nothing to me.
Get over yourself.
How can you say that?
You piss me off.
Cut it out.
Who do you think you are?
Don't talk to me like that.
You make me sick.

He does not care about me.
He is looking for a job.
Great minds think alike.
It is just what I need.
Excuse me, can you come here for a moment?
Yes, is there something wrong?
I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
This isn't what I ordered.
I must have confused the orders.
And also this soup is cold.
I'll bring you a hot one right away.
All the food smells tasty today and makes my mouth water.
Let's line up here.
This line seems a little shorter.
What's on the menu today?
Fish, beef, pork, chicken, vegetables and beancurd.
For staple food we have rice, steamed bread, stuffed buns and noodles.
Oh, we're lucky today, aren't we?
I'd rather take stewed cabbage with beef.
I think I'll take fried fish, because fish is one of my favorites.
That's good, we can share what we have.
You people from south prefer sweet, don't you?
Yes, I like the fish cooked in sweet and sour sauce best.
Your appetite is good.
I'm always feeling hungry.
I'm hungry, let's get something to eat.
Is there a place nearby that we can get something to eat.
There's a Kentucky's not far ahead and there's a McDonald's in down street.
I've heard about it, but never had one.
They sell pieces of fried chicken, you've got to try one this time.
Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes?
I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn.
Would you like an appetizer before your meal?
The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup.
Can I get you anything to drink?
Yes, I'd like a glass of iced tea.
I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad.
I'm starving, so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions?
That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions.
I'm not really in the mood for Italian, actually.
I was thinking of something a bit spicy.
If you want spicy food, then I'd recommend going to a Thai, Indian or Chinese restaurant.
Most of their dishes have sweet sauces.
We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us.
They're a bit expensive, but they do serve large portions of very hot food.
Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money.
They'll still charge us a corkage fee.
Don't worry about money, I'll treat you tonight.
Are you sure? We could go Dutch.
Have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast?
Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality.
To begin with, I have to use chopsticks.
After all, I've been here for two years.
There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told.
In China at least, coffee is often associated with an exotic, well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle.
Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated, middle-class people.
Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar, surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop.
While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace, they are actually showing off.
We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea, rather than coffee, has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people.
Tea represents another facet of popular culture.
While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft, elegant music, a teahouse is often a noisy, crowded, public space.
People visit teahouses to associate with others, playing chess, chatting, or simply listening to operas.
The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest.
What do you usually have for breakfast?
I usually have cereal for breakfast.
But isn't it served with cold milk?
Chinese people don't like to eat cold food.
What's your favorite dish or dishes?
I always order fried spring rolls when I go to Chinatown.
I'm happy to recommond the fish, It testes delicious, and it is today's special.
Our chef is from the coast, and love seafood.
I'd like the steak and mushrooms.
How would you like your steak, rare, mediam, or well-done?
What kind of potatoes would like to go with that, mushed, boiled, or baked?
I'd like cream onion soup please.
We've been waiting for our lunch order for over an hour.
What do we need for the barbecue?
I can't wait to start cooking.
I've bought the grill and charcoal.
I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs.
We'll need some tomato catchup and some barbecue sauce.
Some people like their meat well done, others like it rare.
The great thing about the barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked.
They can cook them themselves to make sure exactly how they like it.
I love your home-made apple pie, It's delicious.
I was just wondering if many Chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant?
Chicago has some great Italian restaurants.
Could you tell me the specials today?
The special today is fried chicken, and beef is good too.
May I have some more beer?
Can we have a table for three, please?
We'd like a non-smoking table, please.
Could you get me the pepper from the cupboard?
Yes, we've got a reservation.
It's illegal to bring food and drinks into the theater.
Do you have any seats available?
What's the special today?
There's so much food on the table, I don't know where to begin.
I feel so full, I don't think I could eat another bite.
This is the nicest room in the district.
You know what, I just had all the walls repainted last month.
It's a well furnished eat-in kitchen.
The stove and the ice-box are in good order, and the plumbing is OK, too.
How much is the rent for this apartment?
Rents are very high in downtown area.
I wonder if you could help me, I'm looking for a room.
Eight dollars fifty a week excluding laundry.
Would it be convenient to see the room?
we're interested in seeing the rooms for rent.
I'm going to try to find a place near the office.
Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one?
It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences.
A friend told me I might find a room here.
25.00 dollars a week, but you can't have visitors.
I've been told you might have a vacant room.
35.00 dollars a week, but I don't allow smoking.
Let's call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments.
I need to find a new place to live.
I didn't realize a single bedroom apartment went for so much these days.
This is a nice place, but you need to get some furniture.
This apartment is nice, but I'd like to find a cheaper one.
My lease ends next month, so I have to find a new place.
I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available.
I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet.
looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs.
Anything you need to have in the place?
I want a bedroom with full bath, and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side.
I am calling about the apartment you advertised.
What kind of apartment are you interested in?
I am interested in one-bedroom. Do you have any available?
You'll be assigned a sheltered parking space at no extra charge.
Let's move out of here. This apartment is too small.
When is the place available?
It sounds nice, but don't forget this is a seedy, run-down neighborhood.
A nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for.
Is the place well-furnished?
This is a very spacious apartment. It's forty pings, including the parking space.
This balcony is perfect for barbecuing.
No pets are allowed in this apartment building, except fish.
We appreciate your letting us have the apartment.
We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent, though?
And we don't need the parking space. I guess we could rent it out.
So how long do you plan to live here?
We'd like to sign a year-long contract, if that's OK.
So the apartment comes unfurnished.
I have another one that's furnished, but I'm not sure you'll like the furniture.
Have you moved into your new house yet?
We just moved in yesterday, actually.
So, what do you think about the place? Are you glad that you moved in?
How old is the house then?
Right now, there are three bedrooms, two bahrooms, a kitchen, a sitting room, a dining room, and a living room.
I can enjoy reading on this balcony in a fine day like this.
The balcony is very beautiful, but I don't like the fact that it faces north.
You don't know that, if the balcony faces north, it will get cool in the summer, but too cold in the winter.
We have the radiator system in winter, don't we?
The nice environment of this apartment is good for our children.
I am most attracted by the price.
Can we buy this house on mortgage?
Could you drive me to the bank?
Go down this road and then turn left.
Miss, where do you want to go?
Could you drop me off at the airport?
Do I need to pay any extra charge for my suitcases?
When's the next bus?
Excuse me, when is the next train to Los Angeles?
I'd like to go to the railway station please.
Is it a long run to the station?
The streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day, aren't they?
Is it the rush hour?
When is the next train to New York City?
A soft seat or hard one?
Shall we share a taxi?
Don't worry about it, I will be happy to share the taxi with you.
Which subway should I take to get to the East Side?
Do you know if there's a Commercial Bank around here?
Straight on, and turn right. Is it far?
Why don't you take a taxi? It'll get you there much faster.
I think I'll take the bus this time just for a change.
We'll get a cab. It's faster than taking the bus or the subway.
We have just arrived from Tokyo and we've been looking for our reserved car of your company all over, but we cannot find it.
You mean you haven't arranged any car?
Excuse me, how do I get to Wall Street?
There's another traffic jam on the highway.
I wonder if there was an accident?
You haven't taken the bus before?
Your seat is in the non-smoking section.
Since I'm a heavy smoker, may I change my seat?
Maybe you can ask some other taxi drivers.
These accidents always cause traffic jams on rainy days.
How much is it to the airport?
Will you please help me with the luggage?
The traffic is not heavy today.
Could you take us to the Fifth Avenue?
Is the traffic very heavy this hour?
My car is having problems.
Which one is the brake again?
I'm glad this car is an automatic.
How much for weekly hire?
How much for daily hire?
I'd like to hire a car.
I have a flat tire.
I'd like to hire a car with driver.
The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on.
Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror.
The tank is almost empty. I guess I'll drive to the petrol station to fill it up.
I would like to rent a car with a good stereo.
We are coming up to a red light, step on the brakes.
The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car.
The road ahead is blocked. There might have been an accident.
Are there many accidents in the city every day?
Please drive slowly, we've got lots of time. Safety first.
Where shall I register, please?
I'll make a medical record for you.
How much do I need to pay for the registration?

You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription.
We must follow the prescription.

You'll probably have a cast on your left arm.
Have you ever been in an emergency room before?

You've got to have patience with him and teach him. It's not easy.
I'm still learning how to control his behavior and my temper.
Tina, you should have more nutritious food.

What kind of currency does the machine accept?
Generally speaking, only RMB, and it only accepts five yuan, ten yuan, and twenty yuan notes and the coins.
Is it the express or the local train?
What are the differences between the express and the local train?
The local train stops at every station and the express train only stops at major stations.
Therefore, the express will save you a lot of time. Of course, the express costs more than the local train.
You can listen to the announcement on the train, and it will tell you when we get there.
Don't miss your train. See you!
I've been waiting here for 15 minutes. Do you know how often does No.3 run?
Are there any landmarks nearby?
Please place all your carry-on luggage on the conveyor.
There're always so many vehicles and pedestrains when crossing crossroads, especially in rush hour.
Making phone calls on the freeway is very dangerous.
Cars are lining up before the toll station. And many people get impatient and keep honking their horns.
The bus driver shouted for the passengers to move to the rear of the bus.
The passengers got off the bus one by one.
I should have taken the bus from the other side of the street.
The bus had a flat tire.
My train arrived thirty minutes behind schedule.
My car broke down in the middle of the road.
It seems that the oil is leaking.
There was no outlet on this road.
Traffic was increasing on the roads into the city's center.
I was lost in the architectural complex.
Excuse me, can you help me? I'm lost.
I'll take you to the bus stop. It's on my route.
There's no bus going in that direction.
Take Bus No.23, and get off at the terminal. You'll see the hospital.
Is this bus schedule still in effect?
Where can I find out departure and arrival time?
Ah, there, I see the sign for ground transportation.
Do you think that is where we catch the hotel shuttle?
A shuttle pulls up to the curb and the door opens.
The speaker will make an announcement that says it's the final stop and all passengers need to disembark.
Climb in and put your suitcases in the luggage rack directly behind the driver's seat. 
The shuttle covers many hotels in the midtown area and I'll make three stops.

How do you "call" a taxi in your country from the side of the road?
Is it common to give the cab driver a tip?
If so, about how much do you give?
Is it more appropriate to sit in the front or back of the taxi?
Do you feel safe going into the subway at all hours in your country?
What's the most readily available form of public transportation where you live?
My wife wanted to take a taxi, but I nixed that idea. It would cost an arm and a leg.
We’re hoping to find a cheaper option.
There are private shuttle services.
 Okay, in that case, a limo service would be out, too. 
Doesn’t your hotel have a courtesy shuttle?
Let's go there on shared bikes.
More and more people choose shared bikes for short trips.
Let's ride shared bikes. It's more environmentally friendly.
How about we using the car-hailing apps?
Car-hailing apps are very convenient. You can directly hail a taxi online.
Let's choose carpooling, because it's cheaper.
This car-hailing app has a lot of coupons recently. It's a good deal.
The driver has a very bad attitude. I'll give him a negative review.
The driver refused to take my order.

28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind spirit with a big heart.
His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.
He was the brother that went with the flow.
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.

Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.
He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.
But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's denied that emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.
They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.
"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.
It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.
He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I'm very emotional because my family are here as well
I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.
He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.
It has been a rollercoaster ride.
Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.
And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
No-one knows yet.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.
Mystery as fish land in Banff garden
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Happily, it all went very well.
Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
Effortless on beam.
Jaw-dropping on floor.
Brilliant all over.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.
Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.
Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.
It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.
The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This is powerful.
Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.
To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.
If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.
And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.
Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.
Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.
He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.
'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.
Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.
Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks
One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'
Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.
Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.
We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.
That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.
To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'
All the product in question has been removed from sale.
How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.
Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.
If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.
Sounds tricky?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.
Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction
A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.
Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished
Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past
Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.
The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s' Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they're setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit pics online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Greenland shark is longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying the sharks, says record goes to a female thought to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five metres in length
French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.
They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."
The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.
"This 5,000-yuan subsidy solved the problem of my pressing need for money."
Zhou Fen, a girl who was registered in the poverty-stricken file of Mipo Village, Changle Town, Huayuan County, received the letter of admission from University of South China.
On August 9, when she was worried about the tuition, the county committee of the Communist Youth League timely offered her a 5,000-yuan subsidy.
Recently, the related county government department has provided a subsidy totaled RMB 2.838 million to over 690 poverty-stricken college students.
Meanwhile, it has organized social fund-raising for students who are extremely poor in financial status to help them complete their studies.
This year, Huayuan County collected more than RMB 18.5 million of educational funds and self-raised more than RMB 2.5 million, which will be injected into the real-name bank accounts of the corresponding students.
"I thought my elder brother and I cannot attend college after my father passed away. Unexpectedly, the county government offered us subsidies so timely." She said gratefully.
As of August 8, Huayuan County had raised more than RMB 21 million for 13,140 poverty-stricken students from various relief funds this first half year.
All poverty-stricken students of the county that should be supported have been supported financially.
According to the reporter on the scene, a large container truck shifted to the fast lane with the command of a traffic policeman. Its container box fell down onto the green road, making a 2cm-deep pit on the roadside.
According to the Xinhua news agency, Australia's New South Wales government announced on the 11th day of the month that it will spend 200 million Australian dollars (about 154 million US dollars) on the biggest ever renovation of the famous Sydney Opera House since its completion.
The renovation would not change the shell shape of the opera house, according to the New South Wales government.
The Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney's landmark buildings, designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon and completed in 1973. It witnesses the arrival of around 8 million visitors each year.
Rory Jeffes, managing director of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes that the Sydney Opera House will make a "turnaround" via this renovation and become one of the world's concert halls with the best sound effects.
Non-permanent residents who have lived in Beijing for more than six months and meet one of the conditions of having a stable and legal employment, having accommodation and having continuous schooling in Beijing can apply for a residence permit.
Recently, the launch of detailed implementation rules for the Residence Permit Provisional Regulation means that the "temporary residence permit" will be upgraded to "residence permit".
A responsible person of the relevant department said that the transition from "temporary residence permit" to "residence permit "means that Beijing will shift from its management of non-permanent residents to multi-directional services for them.
The journalist learnt from the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) today that as of the end of June this year, the tax authorities at all levels have announced a total of 2,470 illegal "blacklist" cases.
It is learned that in July 2014, the SAT led the central government departments in issuing an Information Disclosure Methods For Major Tax Violation Cases along with the Tax Credit Management Approach.
In addition to the illegal facts, legal basis, handling and punishment of these cases, the basic information of the illegal parties and the persons in charge of the relevant intermediaries will be included in the "blacklist" exposure.
Quality inspection, treasury, customs and other government departments also take relevant disciplinary measures against the "blacklist" parties.
"The credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the credit system of the whole society, which indicates that the construction of our social credit system is becoming more and more mature."
"Environmental problems are embodied by the atmosphere, water and soil pollution, but the root still lies in the mode of production and living."
For example, the land development ratio of Jiangsu Province was up to 21% in 2015, ranking top among all provinces and autonomous regions of China.
Therefore, the problems of high pollution, heavy energy consumption and high-ratio land occupation have not been fundamentally addressed in the transformation of production and life styles.
On the one hand, Jiangsu tops in the whole country from the perspective of ecological environment construction achievement of all levels and classes. But on the other hand, the resource and environment bearing pressure is heavy.
To solidly promote the ecological environment protection and governance, we need to fundamentally promote the transformation of production and lifestyle and promote the transformation of people's livelihood from the perspective of ecological civilization construction.
On the 11th day of the month, 42 wind turbine blades produced by China Guodian Corporation was prepared to be shipped and exported to South Africa from the wharf of Lianyungang Port.
Since last year, China Guodian Corporation has exported a total of 163 sets of wind power projects from Lianyungang Port to South Africa.
The third-party company (non-Chinese company) commissioned by the Olympic Organizing Committee for the production of the national flag is located in the Sao Paulo state, Brazil, about 75 kilometers away from the city of Sao Paulo.
To urge the manufacturers to finish the production ASAP, the Consulate-General of China in Sao Paulo sent specially-assigned persons to the manufacturer for in-depth work.
After overtime work for 30 hours, the manufacturer finally completed the Chinese flag production and loaded for transportation. The task was finished 4-5 working days in advance.
It is reported that the flags are expected to arrive in Rio on the 11th day of the month. Then the Olympic Organizing Committee will send the flags to various Olympic venues upon receipt. The whole process will be under the supervision of the Chinese embassy in Brazil.
(Our newspaper report) On the 10th day of the month, the Nantong Municipal Government held a series of negotiation activities concerning Shanghai-Nantong industrial cooperation at the Shanghai International Convention Center. More than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate. More than 20 Hu-Tong industry docking projects worth at least RMB 100 million saw on-site contract signing.
The 20 projects with simultaneous signing have a total investment of RMB 8.063 billion, involving new energy, new materials, modern services and other industries.
Qingdao is China's 12th and also Shandong province's first city to pilot paid use and trade the emission right.
On the 11th day of the month, many companies came to the Qingdao Municipal Emission right Center to submit emission right applications. After acceptance, they shall pay fees for the paid use.
The upcoming first transaction also indicates that Qingdao's emission right trading pilot work officially kicked off. It will also be the first emission right trading deal in Shandong and the first city-level emission right trading in China.
On the morning of the 11th day of the month, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Double Peach Specialty Chemicals (Group) Co., Ltd., came to the trading center to submit the emission right subscription.
Its plant in the old urban area of Qingdao came to a full halt and was moved to the new plant in Pingdu due to environmental reason.
After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form and the construction project environmental impact report, etc., the Qingdao Municipal Emission Right Reserve and Trading Service Center began to review the application materials.
According to the collection standard determined by Qingdao's price bureau and financial sector, the estimated initial emission right fee is about RMB 641,200. The working staff will finish review within 7 working days.
The upcoming completion of the first transaction also indicates that Qingdao emission right trading pilot work will officially kick off. It will also be the first emission right trading in Shandong and the first city-level emission right trading in China.
According to Zhao Xiuping, the company has now invested up to RMB 400 million in environmental protection. Thought it seems to be a big sum, it has a great impact on the enterprise management philosophy and social benefits and also opened up room for enterprise innovation management.
On the same day, Qingdao SF-XC-ZZ Coach Component Co., Ltd. also came to apply for emission rights for its high-speed rail and CRH interior accessory project with an annual output of 4,200 pieces.
The project is a mechanical processing enterprise. Its initial emission rights for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) are 0.514 tons/year and 0.052 tons/year, respectively.
The paid use and trading of air pollutant emission right cover the city's key industrial enterprises for the production and supply of electricity and heat.
The current pollutant discharging units which had obtained environmental impact assessment as of January 1, 2016, will be exempt from fees for paid use.
"The obtaining of paid use of emission rights is not equal to the obtaining of the right for illegal discharge, so companies cannot discharge pollutants at will."
Companies of illegal and excessive sewage must be punished in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations, according to Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau. It is impossible to allow enterprises to circumvent punishments via purchasing emission rights.
In other words, we need to crack down on environmental violations through legal means and severely punish the enterprises' over standard discharge behaviors, so as to protect the environment and public health.
Now for their own interests, enterprises have shown higher enthusiasm in pollution control, cherished limited emission rights and reduced emissions of pollutants.
With the economic interests drive, to reduce pollutants' discharge has shifted from the government's mandatory behavior into a conscious market behavior, so as to truly protect the environment, nature and public health.
Emission right, also known as "dumping right", means the right to discharge pollutants. It refers to the right for emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment in line with the law within the quota assigned by the government.
This right is essentially the right of the emitters to occupy, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources.
In the next step, under the premise that the total discharge of pollutants does not exceed the total allowable emission volume, discharge capacities of the internal resources of pollution will be able to be swapped via currency exchange.
The emission right trading concept was put forward by American economist Dyers in 1968 and began to be adopted by the United States for the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources in the 1970s.
Its pilot work in China began in 2007 and now it has been fully implemented in 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.
According to the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in order to assist the air attack of the six strategic bombers on the "Islamic State" target in Syria, a number of Russian fighters took off from the Hmeimin air base in Syria to provide support.
On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement on the Syrian conflict. The ceasefire agreement will be implemented since February 27.
Under the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations including "Islamic State" and "Salvation Front", which were identified by the United Nation Security Council.
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure in the base and the living conditions of the Russian soldiers will be protected correspondingly.
If the extremist forces were not hit, these forces will be extended to Russia, he added.
Although Russia and the West did not reach an agreement on the cooperation against the extremist forces of Syria, Russia would strengthen cooperation with parties like Syria, Iran and Iraq in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia, at the invitation of the Syrian government, began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces.
On March 15 this year, Russia's major military forces in Syria began to evacuate, but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the air base in Hmeimin and the naval base in Tartus.
In the case of renovating old houses and successful startup in his hometown, He Peijun is making a good example by inheriting a 100-year old house and telling a story about the land heritage.
Today, 100,000 people on average visit Zhushan each year, bringing a variety of ideas or seeking inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the village and the city should companionship, just like mother and child. No matter strong or weak. There is no need for any party to be governed by the other party. Such a relationship is warm.
There is no fixed pattern of rural development, but it is quite difficult to just rely on spontaneous rural changes. A critical thing is to encourage the right people to go to villages.
The traffic control department of Songjiang District, Shanghai, recently used electronic police to monitor whether drivers play mobile phone while driving. As a result, more than 30 cases were detected in a week.
With the popularity of smart phones, mobile phones become more and more interesting. WeChat chatting, microblogging, playing games and even shopping on Taobao have become normal. It seems that many people cannot do without the phone for a moment, and cannot stop doing so even when driving.
According to the Road Traffic Safety Law, mobile phones playing is banned and defined as one of the "behaviors threating driving safety".
Unfortunately, due to some reasons such as the large number of illegal cases and difficulty in obtaining evidence, those people have never been punished and make the law become a kind of decoration.
If the traffic control department can determine to declare war to the mobile phone playing behavior during driving and normalize such measures, such illegal behaviors will surely be curbed.
The public security organ shall be strict with household registration management by gradually establishing electronic and paper files for people without Hukou (household registration) and ensure data integrity and validity of the files.
The public security organ shall promptly notify the relevant departments of the registration of people without Hukou.
The policy measures that are inconsistent with this implementation idea will receive a centralized cleanup. Careful modifications should be made for those that need such modifications while resolutely abolish those that need to be abolished.
In the collective greenhouse of Donglin Village, Taicang City, the 48-year-old Wang Xuefen is leading workers to spray pesticides on pear trees.
The 150 mu (a unit of area, one "mu"=0.0667 hectares) of orchards and more than 10 species only require 12 workers plus a technical engineer to do the job.
Last year, the income was RMB 50,000 in total. I cannot earn so much if I work in a factory because in view of my age.
Last year, the income of Donglin Village reached RMB 22 million, of which the total agricultural income accounted for nearly a half.
According to Su Qifang, the village secretary, per capita land cultivation area has increased each year from 50 mu at the beginning to over 100 mu. The revenue per mu increases every year and the income of professional farmers also has potential for growth every year.
With shares allocated to each villager, the highlight of the southern Jiangsu rural collective economic reform is to clarify the property rights of rural collective operation and to explore political and economic separation.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations of Anzhen Street, Xishan District, Wuxi, worked with the village committee to implement "management of differential accounts". The village committee implements rural public affairs management while the cooperative organizations were mainly engaged in business.
With two different accounts for the two kinds of organizations, this can prevent the village cadres from participating in collective asset management corruption.
Zhu Baoping, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Committee, said that the next step of Jiangsu is to continue to promote the reform of community joint stock cooperation system, encourage farmers to seek development via unification and establish a village-level democratic power operation mechanism.
According to Zhu Baoping, they should further push the reform, develop community joint stock cooperation, quantify assets to community members and distribute them to farmers to clarify property rights.
Through the "Internet +" measure, farmers will be provided with the rights to know and to participate in decision-making and democratic management, actually making it a standard operation mechanism for joint-stock cooperation.
At present, the new collective economy in southern Jiangsu villages mainly consists of four development modes, namely asset leasing, enterprise stock, agricultural development and joint development.
It is learned that overseas exhibitions have become an important platform for the Belt and Road Initiative construction of Zhejiang Province.
The success of these overseas exhibitions has accumulated valuable experience and laid a good foundation for the continuous exploration in emerging markets along the Belt and Road Initiative-related countries and building overseas exhibition integrated platform.
PEAK will always be oriented to promoting consumer demand, building a sports industry ecosphere and accelerating the strategic upgrading from single sporting goods manufacturing enterprise to professional sports service enterprises.
Another 34 people were injured, among which three firefighters suffered from minor injuries and were now discharged from hospital, Hamir added.
As some of the tenants were still missing, he also called on residents of the apartment which caught fire to contact the authorities.
It is reported that Ms. Mariana Turay who has been living in this apartment for 30 years said that "It seems like a bomb falling down."
It is reported that the local fire brigade spent an hour and 45 minutes to put out the fire and residents of the nearby buildings were allowed to return in a few hours.
American Red Cross staff estimated that about 100 people were homeless, 60 to 70 among which were mostly hispanic and stayed in the shelters nearby temporarily.
On August 11, the first Jinzhou Wetland Tourism Festival kicked off at Jinzhou Qriental Huadicheng "Hequan Lake".
In 2014, the revenue of tourism industry accounted for 10% of the GDP of Jinzhou and reached 11.3% in 2015.
The Qriental Huadicheng Wetland Hot Spring tourist area is located at No.1, Linghai Section, Binhai Highway, Dayou Economic Development Zone, Jinzhou City. It is 50 km away from the Linghai downtown area and 70 km from Panjin City.
There are 3,000-square-meter indoor spa and 4,600-square-meter outdoor spring.
Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "handsome hands" encourage her to embark on shooting career, which saw several "reverses"
Zhang Donghong, a villager of East Park Village, Xiang'an District, Xiamen, changed an old 29-inch TV into a new 65-inch large TV just a few days before.
The ordinary farmer has a daughter named Zhang Binbin, who is the one to win the three-posture final silver medal of the Olympic Games Women's 50-meters rifle game for China on the evening of the 11th day of the month.
Just then and just in front of this new TV set, the Zhang Donghong couple and their dozens of relatives and friends were witnessing the magic process for the couple's daughter to catch up and reverse from almost being eliminated in the preliminaries to almost winning the game.
During the competition of the that day, Zhang Binbin once ranked in the lower intermediate level and it seemed that she was still quite far away from the final.
But her parents and friends did not give up, kept watching the live broadcast and saw that as other players finish the game, Zhang Binbin raised her rank all the way and finally came to the final. At this time, a burst of cheers took place in her home.
In the final, Zhang Binbin also started from lagging behind and shot more stably and won the silver medal with just 0.2 rings behind the champion.
Actually, the 27-year-old Zhang Binbin has almost missed the hard-won silver medal for several times in the 16-year shooting career.
According to her mother Zhang Xiaolong, Zhang Binbin brought a few "persuaders" from her village when they were hesitating.
These persuaders were girls and boys of her village who were recommended to attend the training at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's elder female cousin.
However, shortly after coming to the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again took the initiative to return to a Xiang'an school to continue her study because of her family difficulties.
But after repeated efforts of her enlightening teacher, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
And after she came into the provincial team, Zhang Binbin returned home again because she found it almost hopeless to enter the national team after a long time.
This time, not only the coach Zhang Yajie, but also the leaders and coaches of the Xiamen shooting archery sports center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home. With their efforts, Zhang Binbin was finally persuaded to return to the provincial team.
Just like yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl achieved several reversals on her shooting way with her insistence.
"Each coach has his own method to choose players. I decided to take her once I saw her beautiful hands."
Zhang Donghong also recalled that in the training test, although the results of her daughter were not the best, they were very stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches.
During the training process of Zhang Binbin, it was the input of this farmer girl that impressed Zhang Yajie most.
He recalled that more than a year after Zhang Binbin came into the Xiamen shooting team, the team carried out a long-time gun-holding training for standing shooting, requiring players to stand still for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child, with the hobbies of painting and making toys.
"I used to make clothes and do some needlework while Binbin picked up some scraps to make her own dolls."
My daughter often made toys by sewing, said her mother. Plus, she is good at painting and could make everything animated, from the doll's facial features to clothing.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and her family are more often separated than being together. As she can only return home during festivities, she mainly contacts her family by phone at ordinary times.
Zhang Binbin seldom complained of her hard work but talked more with her parents about some good things, according to her parents.
Since they cannot often see their daughter, they carefully keep her paintings finished in her childhood and honors received in the past.
Zhang Xiaolong showed her daughter's cartoon drawings to the journalist, "Had she not become a shooter, she should keep drawing."
In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there was a cupboard filled with medals and certificates.
Zhang Donghong put away the medals neatly and placed all certificates into files for storage. "These are honors obtained by Binbin after over ten years' efforts. We cherished them."
Recently, Hebei Cixiao Fund offered a 16,000-yuan relief to six families who lost their relatives in Xiaozuo, Taitou and Guiquan Villages of Jingxing County.
This is another condolence and care activity after the fund association released the call for finding "bereaved children and lonely old men caused by the flood disaster in July 19, 2016".
The 719 heavy rainfall caused heavy disaster to many cities of Hebei Province and resulted in the flood disaster of some regions in the province. During the period, some people died or were missing.
The good man Lao Tie sacrificed his life when he helped the community on drainage, leaving a 2-year-old kid and his pregnant wife. The moving story of the good man Lao Tie affected the entire provincial capital.
On August 4, the working personnel of Hebei Provincial Cixiao Fund and volunteers of Hebei Brand Association came to his home and offered his relatives with 3,200-yuan love donation.
When Ye Li, the vice president of Hebei Brand Association acknowledged the situation of Lao Tie, they immediately decided to carry out "love charity" activities among enterprise members to help Lao Tie's family to tide over the difficulty.
Established in August 2015, Hebei Provincial Cixiao Fund, also known as the Hebei Volunteer Service Foundation Cixiao Fund, was initiated by the Hebei Brand Preparatory Committee.
According to a Hong Kong Oriental Daily report made on August 12, the current diamond sales in mainland China were accused of three major problems, including false diamond clarity mark aimed to raise sales price, false diamond weight and lack of aftersales warranty.
Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers. The diamond cutting technology of local artisans is well-known. All diamonds on sale have undergone rigorous identification, deeply welcomed by the mainland ladies.
"A small cloth bag with a handful of diamonds, which is very light and can be held in a hand, is worth of almost one million yuan", a woman surnamed Liu who participated in the purchase of diamonds told her experience in Antwerp last June to the mainland media.
She hid the diamonds in her lingerie and carried them all day along, including when she went to toilet and took bath. She felt quite nervous in both walking and sleeping.
She said the diamond she bought in Antwerp was priced at about RMB 55,000 per gram and diamond of the same quality was priced by retailers at about RMB 111,000 in Xia'men.
Recently, she sold the diamond at a 20% price premium and earned two hundred thousand yuan at a time.
According to the provisions of the mainland China customs, diamonds are neither supplies nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods. So such diamonds should be declared at entry and exit. Otherwise, the people who carry them shall be classified as smuggling and may be sentenced to jail.
According to foreign media reports, on the 10th day of the month of the local time, Downing Street announced that United Kingdom Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend her summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place.
According to some media, after the United Kingdom referendum about exit from the European Union, the new United Kingdom Prime Minister chose to spend her vacation in the "neutral country" on the European continent, Switzerland. This is symbolic.
The symbolic neutrality nature of the Switzerland affected the choice of the United Kingdom Prime Minister's first resort, according to the United Kingdom "Guardian".
Teresa Mei chose to take a vacation in Switzerland. This is the first time that a United Kingdom prime minister chose to go vacation in Switzerland after Margaret Thatcher, according to the United Kingdom newspaper Daily Telegraph.
The choice of these two female prime ministers is quite a contrast to the vacation selection of hotter places by Blair and Cameron
It is reported that the new United Kingdom Prime Minister Teresa Mei will return to Rondon on August 24. A series of important work and activities will be waiting for her.
The United Kingdom parliament will resume on September 5. The subject matter covers the second Brexit referendum required on the internet.
On June 23, the United Kingdom held a referendum for Brexit, but the new prime minister did not want to start the content of article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which is related to the exit of member countries from the EU, before the end of the year.
There are 1,325 existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan. Its category number and quantity rank first in Anhui Province.
As the inheritance of intangible cultural heritage projects of Anhui Province mainly relies on face-to-face passage, many intangible cultural heritage projects are on the verge of failing to be handed down from past generations. So the application of digital technology for conservation is imperative.
According to the work plan of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress this year, the Standing Committee plans to listen to the deliberation of special work reports, and carry out the implementation of banking supervision and management law and special inquiry about serving local economic development.
In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research groups to conduct research in some cities to prepare for the special inquiry.
Hua Jianhui pointed out that this was the first time that the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress listened to and deliberated on the special work report of vertical administration department and carry out special inquiries. It is the active exploration for enhancing and exploring the supervision work of the Provincial People's Congress.
In the exercise directing department of Kashi, Xinjiang, with the order of the director, the armed police in three regions, namely Kashi, Hotan and Aksu, followed the order quickly, implemented motor assembly and left for the exercise combat zone.
China's Mars program kicks off
China's Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling at one time, which has never done by other countries.
China's Mars exploration launch target is to step around, land and patrol at one time. Such a task is quite arduous.
Because there is only one time window for the Mars probe in every 26 months, experts are closely working on the project plan and try to launch the first Mars probe in 2020.
Although China's aircraft has entered a deep space, it is still essential to finish the task of Mars exploration, which marks that China has stepped into the deep space exploration era in a true sense, according to Xu Dazhe.
"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most energy efficient to launch the vehicle."
"Considering the mass of Mars detectors, it is the mission for China's Long March 5 carrier rocket to complete the launch mission."
China's Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling in one mission, which has never occurred in other countries. They once achieved surrounding and landing before in other countries, but failed at landing.
Mars exploration involves a lot of technical areas. In particular, although the rover is a space detector, it has a distinctive feature compared with the general space detector.
In other words, the Mars probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the ability to find obstacles.
According to Pang Zhihao, a researcher of the fifth institute of China's Aerospace Science and Technology Group, the reason for human being to favor Mars exploration is that Mars detection has significant scientific and technical meanings and it even matters to the future of human beings.
Currently, the Mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration.
Therefore, the human beings hope to establish a base of residence on the Mars one day, and immigrate to Mars, thereby turning it into a second home for mankind.
A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth in the past. It took billions of years of evolution to change into the current state of thin atmosphere, low temperature and water depletion, etc.
Therefore, the detection or manned landing on the Mars for research can help propose a pre-arranged planning of preventing Earth from becoming the second Mars.
As of June 2016, the world conducted a total of 114 lunar explorations, including 43 Mars detection missions.
However, ever since the 1990s, a total of 18 human explorations have been carried out and only 14 lunar detections have been conducted.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers at work, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are at work.
World space powers have developed a detection plan with the Mars system as target. So we can see the current Mars detection is hotter than that of moon detection.
On Nov. 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars probe "Mangalian". Then it became Asia's first country for successful detection of the Mars.
"Mangalian" is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of the Mars and explore whether there are signs of methane and life on the Mars.
The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the Martian atmosphere for aerodynamic configuration and parachute deceleration.
According to Sun Zezhou, the chief designer of a Mars detector of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Mars exploration task is confronted with many technical challenges.
The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of that of the Earth, with high uncertainty.
Scientists have not had a thorough understanding of Mars factors, such as its changes and storm characteristics.
A dust storm similar to the Earth's dust is often formed in the Mars in the summer, which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy. So a "sleep" mode must be designed for the Mars rover so that it can wait patiently until the departure of dust storms.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the energy supply for Mars detection.
This requires that the detector's sun wing area to be larger and constantly adjust so as to align with the sun direction.
In addition, since the gravity of the Mars is only 38% of that of the earth and much higher than that of the Moon surface, so the probe requires higher power.
"The core and the most difficult part of the Mars exploration mission are the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration process after the probe enters Martian atmosphere. There is just one chance to ensure success."
According to Sun Zezhou, it must rely on the detector to complete the entire process because the distance between the Earth and the Mars is quite large.
Because there is not so much propellant to offset the high speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing on the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth.
The way to detect the Mars is similar to the way to detect the moon in general. The entire process is also "surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars, according to Pang Zhihao.
Because the distance between the Mars and the earth is larger than that between the Moon and the Earth, it needs to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties for Mars exploration.
According to Taiwanese media reports, Lin Quan, the head of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, announced yesterday morning, "Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations by political parties and their accompanying organizations" will take effective since today.
KMT Vice Chairman Zhan Qixian said, "Kuomintang, with a hundred years of history, will step down otherwise without social commitment and responsibility."
Lin Quan stressed that if the political party, accompanying organization or trustees are in violations of the regulations which prohibit provisions ban, the Commission will investigate and punish "according to the law".
Lin Quan also announced that Hong Peigen, "Deputy Director of the Independent Commission against Corruption", will serve as the vice chairman of the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee.
He said that Gu Lixiong will be the most appropriate candidate for the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations. The experience of Hong Peigen who dealt with the major cases will serve as the foundation for the committee to uncover the related ill-gotten party assets.
As long as there are party assets today, no one will give you social donations, according to Zhan Qixian. So if the party assets were all confiscated, then Kuomintang can ask for social support and sponsorship. "You will have a chance to go when there are really no assets now."
Zhan Qixian also stressed that even if the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations goes into effect and the Kuomintang party assets are not fully confiscated, the rest will continue to be confiscated as promised, the party asset will go null and the party will start from scratch.
Original title: Lawsuit Launched by "Corridor Doctor" Lan Yuefeng against CCTV Host Wang Zhi'an for Reputation Infringement Fails in First Instance
According to the Legal Evening News: Because the CCTV host Wang Zhi'an published his remarks against the "corridor doctor" event on microblogging, Lan Yuefeng brought Wang Zhi'an and Beijing Micro Dream Chuangke Network Technology Co., Ltd. to the court.
Yesterday afternoon, Haidian court ruled the case. According to the verdict, Wang Zhi'an and Micro Dream Company did not constitute the infringement and dismissed the Lan Yuefeng for all the claims.
At the beginning of 2014, Wang Zhi'an, a reporter of CCTV found after his survey that although the Lan Yuefeng event (sitting in the corridor for more than 600 days) was shaped as the tragic hero suppressed by the media, these reports had a lot of false information.
On March 29, 2014, the "Corridor Doctor" program produced by CCTV news survey went live.
All information about the so-called excessive medical treatment reported by Lan Yuefeng to the media do not have any evidence support.
In the microblogging with real-name certification, Wang Zhi'an also said that the reason for Lan Yuefeng to become this is his stubborn characters and paranoid personality".
Lan Yuefeng claimed that Wang Zhi'an should delete the microblogging posts, apologize to him and pay RMB 100,000 as the mental damage solatium.
In the court hearing, the two sides argued whether Wang Zhian violated the reputation right of Lan Yuefeng.
Highlight of the 12th day of the month: at the beginning of Track and Field Events, the Chinese team is quite busy and the women's football association aims to become the top four of the bicycle games
The bicycle game is expected to realize "a breakthrough to the zero gold medal record" in the Olympic Games while the Women's World Cup girls will challenge Germany team, the world champion winner for twice and are expected to become the top four.
Wang Zhen was quite outstanding in the recent two races. He won a silver medal for the athletics world championship held in Beijing last year and was upgraded to the individual project champion in the world championship this May.
According to foreign media reports, Zhang Huizhen, a 27-year-old Korean archery female player, won the gold medal in the women's archery individual tournament. This is her second Olympic gold medal following the one for team competition. This made her a double winner.
Zhang Huizhen is considered as a late bloomer. She regrets not winning the last session of the Rondon Olympic Games tickets before, but now she proudly stands on the top of the Rio Olympic podium.
Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in Lisa Wenglu, a total score of 6-2 in the women's archery finals at the Samba Boulevard in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
She did archery for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school. She did not win the first individual tournament gold medal until she was 27 in 2014. So she is a late bloomer.
Zhang Huizhen recalled, "My performance before high school was too bad to enable me to participate in the national competition.
Zhang Huizhen was only ranked the fourth at the Rondon Olympic Games qualification trials. Unfortunately, she lost the Olympic admission and just watched her colleague and good friend Qi Fubei win two gold medals.
Zhang Huizhen talked about his gold winning after the women's individual awards ceremony of archery. "I tried to shoot one by one until the last. Maybe it is because this brings me good results and makes me contented."
Qi Fubei, the 28-year-old Korean archery "No.1", and the Rondon Olympic Games archery individual tournament winner, won the bronze medal.
Qi Fubei was defeated by Zhang Huizhen in the semifinals and competed for the bronze medal with the Mexican player Alexandra Valencia.
Qi Fubei shed tears after she knew she won the bronze medal, from which we can see her pressure.
Firstly, the coaching staff accumulated rich experience in his gradual study. Secondly, it needs scientific training, which should be accumulated over time.
The archery team helped the team players focus and remain unbiased via military training and going through a cemetery during night.
Although not yet confirmed, it is said by many sources that Apple's 2016 autumn conference will be held in September, and iPhone7 would really hit the market.
Despite no response from Apple, there are news release about the function and configuration of the new iPhone. There are even the images of iPhone7 "real machine prototype" on the internet.
The new generation of iPhone is really "eye-catching", hot and hard-to-get. If you want to buy the genuine at the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This has further dampened people's enthusiasm for the new iPhone. "It is lengthened, but cannot be used to cast holographic images! This generation is so terrible."
iPhone7, just like other iPhones, carries countless secrets before birth.
In addition, there are a number of sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will have the 3.5mm headphone jack cancelled, and adopt Bluetooth connection and charging interface instead, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple will allow headset manufacturers to produce headset products via producing charging interface.
Another evidence to confirm this message is that Apple allows the headphone manufacturer to produce headphone via the connection of charge interface.
Whether these news are true or false will not be unveiled until the 2016 Apple autumn news conference.
But this does not prevent the industry insiders from being optimistic about the prospects of iPhone7 - many people think that iPhone7 will be likely to become the last major upgrade of Apple's iPhone series, although it can be seen from the data released by the market research institution IDC that the market share of iPhone will decline to some degree.
Among them, Goldman Sachs ranked Apple's stock to be the rating of "buying" while BMO analyst thought that iPhone7 will achieve a historical high sales.
Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth will likely be more than 20%, which is entirely due to the introduction of iPhone7.
7% of respondents expected to buy iPhone7, while the rate for iPhone6 was only 4% two years ago.
It is learned that currently 20% of user groups of iPhone6 or 6Plus have such a plan to purchase iPhone7. This is a rather high proportion.
Secondly, according to expert analysis, most of the iPhone fans like to replace their own iPhones every two generations.
According to statistics, among all iPhone users, about 26% of users have not changed their phones for two years. That is, almost 120 million users of iPhones have been using the same iPhone for two years.
According to media, Taiwan witnessed several earthquakes during the production period of iPhone7. "The destruction of TSMC production facilities is beyond imagination and may impact the initial supply of iPhone7."
Balance between supply and demand will affect the average users, so it is time to choose a good channel and purchase the genuine iPhone7 for the first time.
According to informed sources, recently, Suning executives and Apple frequently meet, with the purpose to prepare adequate supply.
Operators have negotiated with Suning. So it is foreseeable that, with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, lower prices and more intimate services will surely be brought to users.
"With the lowest price, the consumer may "buy iPhone7 with just 7 yuan per day".
Adequate supply and a variety of concessions will alleviate the pressure of iPhone7 buying. Suning's logistics will change such good feeling into more intuitive sense of experience.
Maybe you'll get a call at midnight. "Hello. This is from Suning Tesco. We are calling to say your iPhone7 is here."
The organizers hope that the cultural relics exhibition will enhance the understanding of local people on the history of Chinese culture, thereby enhancing the mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
As part of the European tour, Barcelona's "Ming Dynasty Heritage Exhibition" will continue until early October.
According to the semi-annual report of the year 2016 released by Huaxia Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank yesterday, China Securities Finance Corporation Limited (CSFC) will once again buy their shares in the second quarter.
Among them, CSFC will hold an additional 29.2931 million shares of Huaxia Bank. By the end of June, CSFC will increase its shares of Huaxia Bank to 387 million shares, raising its shares of Huaxia Bank from 3.35% to 3.62%.
According to the estimates of China Merchants Securities, deducted from the shares, CSFC will hold another 38 million shares of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank in the second quarter and raise its shares to almost 600 million shares, which account for 2.77% of the bank shares.
Recently, the Shizibang Lotus Park of Zhengfu Village, Tongxiang City, Zhejiang Province, will be open to villagers and tourists formally.
Composed of more than 100 small circular ponds, the park is planted with more than 300 varieties of ornamental lotus and water lilies, etc.
With ornamental value for leisure and economic benefits, its lotus industry has become the highlights for the development of new villages.
According to foreign media reports, the "green pool" incident of Rio Olympic Games gained much attention because its diving pool water was changed from blue to green.
However, on the morning of the 10th day of the month, the water of the water polo match adjacent to the water pool also turned green.
An Australian water polo contestant said that he felt tingling in eyes and would like to shed tears.
Previously, officials of the Rio Olympic Games confirmed the greening of water and said the water color was due to weaker alkalinity and will not affect the athlete's health.
But according to an Australian athlete, after winning the games with its Japanese counterpart, he felt tingling in eyes and wanted to shed tears after the games.
When the water of diving pool turned green first, the hosting party worked overtime to deal with the diving pool problems on the evening of the 9th day of the month and found the rapid change of water polo pool on the morning of the 10th day of the month.
During the competition period of the Australian and Japanese teams, the environmental conditions of the water polo pond gradually worsened, but the official stressed that they would manage to restore the water quality of the two pools to their original on the 11th day of the month.
"The alkalinity of water in the diving pool firstly turned weak after the yesterday afternoon," said Mario Andrada, the spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games.
"We learned about a series of causes that may trigger the discoloration of water and result in the alkalinity of water quality."
The water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the swimming pool to determine whether the water quality meets criteria. "
"We have been following the normal procedure these days, but we may have overlooked the impact of more athletes on water quality."
"But the change in water color certainly has no effect on health, especially for athletes."
"This independent team confirms our assessment and also acknowledged the measures we have taken to restore the normal color and normal chemical status of the pool."
"We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain."

Urumqi Normalizes Operating Order of Independent Traveler Tourism Market and Says that Travel Agencies Must Sign Contracts with Tourists
Currently, Xinjiang has entered peak tourist season. In order to regulate the management order of tourism FIT market, Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment worked with the law enforcement detachment of the Urumqi transportation authority yesterday to investigate and deal with the non-normative travel vehicles existent in the tourism FIT market, and the low contract signing between the travel agency and tourists.
At 8 O'clock of yesterday morning, around 10 buses packed with tourists parked around the Kempinski Hotel. These vehicles are mostly used by individual group that went for Tianchi for one-day tour.
"Hello, I am from the Urumqi City Tourism Bureau. Did you sign a contract with the travel agency?"
Yu Bin, the working staff of law enforcement detachment of the Urumqi Transportation Authority explained, "The foreign tourist bus and bus line worked on tourist transport project in Urumqi market, but they did not have qualification."
"A fine of 30,000 to 100,000 yuan will be imposed for operation beyond scope. The driver who did not have a qualification certificate will pay RMB 2,000 for fine."
It is reported that the Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment has investigated the places including West Park and Hongshan where the independent travelers are centralized.
After analyzing the two inspections, Ma Qi, the deputy head of the Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment, said that, "Safety first, standardization second. There is no trifle on the travel vehicles. And people will be injured and killed in groups in case of any questions."
"We have worked with the transportation authority to launch continuous inspections on the market to normalize the car use behaviors of travel agencies to ensure the safety of tourists."
On the morning of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
Sheng Laiyun, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and head of the National Economic Statistics Division, said that, in July, some of indexes of the national economy slowed relatively but were still in the reasonable range.
According to the data of National Bureau of Statistics, the fixed asset investment growth, total imports and other data in July came down.
As for the national economy in July, I would like to use the words of the Premier, "the shape is volatile and the potential is still good", said Sheng Laiyun. This is a better way to summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that "the shape is volatile" refers to the fall of growth rate of some economic indicators in July.
In July, as the domestic and international economy still in the deep adjustment, the international situation is complex and ever changing and the world economic recovery failed to meet expectations, the export pressure remained heavy.
As for the domestic situation, the whole economy is still in the critical stage and is suffering pains of adjustment and the economy is under great downward pressure, some indicators were still fluctuating.
There was a special case in July, when serious floods, high temperature and hot weather brought some impact on the production and operation of some areas, according to Sheng Laiyun.
According to the recent report of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people were affected, with direct economic losses of more than RMB 200 billion.
From the view of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees.
The cargo turnover growth rate in July fell 3.6 percentages month on month and floods in these areas had a certain impact on traffic.
In view of these factors, it is quite normal and predictable to have some fluctuations in some indicators in July.
He said, "The potential is still good" means that despite the fallback of economic growth, the overall economic performance is stable and steady. And the good momentum has not changed.
In July, the CPI rose by 1.8%, with a month-on-month rise of 0.2%. From January to July, The CPI rose by 2.1%, so the overall price situation was stable.
According to the statistics of hot weather in the districts and counties by the portal of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Meteorology, in addition to Youyang, people in the rest of the city can receive different amounts of high temperature subsidy.
At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standards of the allowance, but the standards issued by provinces and municipalities are not the same, and people in Chongqing receive the allowance according to the standard of high-temperature working days.
In case of temperature between 35 and 37℃, people can receive allowance of no less than 10 yuan per day. In case of temperature above 37℃, people can receive allowances of no less than 15 yuan per day.
In case of temperature above 40℃, staff working in high temperature can receive up to 20 yuan per day of allowance (but for laborers who enjoy the high temperature job allowance).
In accordance with this standard, people in Kaizhou which has the largest number of high temperature days can receive 330 yuan last month. And people in Chengkou with the least days of high temperature can receive 80 yuan. And because the maximum temperature of Youyang did not meet the high temperature standards, there is no high temperature allowance.
In the past, many companies adopt cool drinks as high temperature allowance. The city safety supervision bureau deemed that this behavior does not meet the current regulation.
Employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of workers in case of terminating work and reducing working hours in high temperature weather.
The city's Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said that if employees did not receive high temperature allowance while working under high temperature, they may fight for the legitimate rights and interests via the labor dispute mediation organization or dial 12333 for complaint.
If the employer refuses to pay the high temperature allowance, the laborer may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources social security at the county level or above.
At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage and not welfare, such an allowance shall be included in the total wages, with tax deducted.
So the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage, it must be issued in cash and not substituted by physical objects such as drinks.
The newly-built Urumqi station is located in Urumqi high-speed rail area, with the whole construction area of around 100,000 square meters.
The layer 1 and 2 are for entrance, waiting room and office, commercial use while the layer -1 is for exit.
At present, Urumqi station is Xinjiang's largest integrated transport hub, integrated with high-speed rail, rail transportation, public transportation and rental as one. People can achieve a variety of seamless dockings.
There are a total of 3 ticket offices on the north and south sides of the platform layer, equipped with 39 manual ticketing windows and 34 automatic ticket machines.
There are a total of 30 channels on the east and west side of the waiting hall. Passengers can check the ticket on the ticket number for quick inspection and waiting.
If you need help, you can enjoy timely services by pressing a nearby one of the 41 call buttons in the station.
From July 1 onwards, the old passenger station, that is, the passenger train of Urumqi South Station is shifted to Urumqi station.
In other words, all the CRH trains and the 30 pairs of other trains departing from Xinjiang can be parked at Urumqi Station.
Now, passengers can buy tickets at these two stations. The train passing time between these two stations is about 10 minutes. Passengers need to pay attention to the detailed name of the initial and terminal station on the ticket.
Urumqi new passenger station, after its official launching into operation, will become an important platform to build the national integrated transport city and promote the construction of "Silk Road Economic Zone" and the new district.
Gracia is a cute female toucan, exuding the breath of tropical rain forest.
In Costa Rica, one of the Central American countries, Toucan Gracia and its story have long been known.
At the press conference on August 10, after postoperative rehabilitation, Gresham finally appeared and showed people its brand new 3D printing plastic beak.
This toucan, which had its beak broken and was dying just one year and a half ago, finally regained its new life.
This day not only announced that it has restored health by 100%, but also signaled its move into the luxury aviary to meet its human friends.
The newcomer Grecia was slightly shy initially, but soon became lively, rolling in the basin frolic and eating grapes with a new beak.
In order to remind people of its damage it once suffered from, the technical staff did not give it a new beak color, but retained the original white color of the 3D print material.
The beak is a thin layer of horny sheath, which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bones to support.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt.
An animal rescue center, ornithologists and a US 3D printing company worked together to prepare several "test beaks" for Gracia and finally built a "perfect beak" for it.
Now Gracia can use the new beak to drink water, eat things, and even peck tiny grains.
"The design of the finished product costs about two months and it just takes 4-5 hours to print it."
"3D printing is not a future technology but indeed becoming part of your life," said Thomas Lange, chairman of SG3D, a US printing company, in an interview by Xinhua International journalists.
In January 2015, Gracia, lying on a farm in the town of Alajuela in the middle of Costa Rica, was found with blood covering on its body.
At that time, its beak was cruelly broken by a group of young people. It was completely unable to eat and dying.
After the tragedy of the Gracia was reported by the media, there is a wave of animal anti-abuse calls inside and outside Costa Rica.
People demand to establish more rigorous animal protection laws to enhance the punishment against abusers.
People came spontaneously to try their utmost to help Gracia restore its life before hurting.
Even the inventor of the 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, was also involved in the design of the Gracia beak.
"The situation of Gracia is very special, and its residual beak is less than 1 centimeter long, so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak."
"We first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis, which is slightly longer than the rest of the upper part of its beak, and fixed it on its beak with glue."
"This can reduce the risk of further intrusive damage to Gracia," Lange told journalists of Xinhua International.
Before installing the prosthesis, the staff cleared the broken beak of Gracia every day to prevent infection.
Thousands of miles away, the story of the Toucan Gracia touched the famous documentary director Paula El Reidia and the news channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new beak, and recorded a documentary "The Country of Toucan", which was played this month on the Animal Planet Channel.
The documentary "The State of the Toucan" shows people how a small Toucan has changed a country and how people get involved in the fight against the torture of animals.
Core Tip: Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of small independent Chinese oil refineries, especially those that are called "teapots".
Japan's largest oil company JX Energy believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn." the Cankaoxiaoxi website reported on August 12.
Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of small independent Chinese oil refineries, especially those that are called "teapots".
The quality of China's oil products is gradually close to those of their Japanese counterparts because the Chinese government has strengthened environmental protection regulations.
Before obtaining the import license for crude oil, "teapot refineries" generally refine oil from the heavy oil, which has high sulfur content and is imported from Russia.
The petroleum products are poor in quality due to high sulfur content, which has become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining crude oil import license, "teapot refineries" can import Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil, which have low sulfur contents and have improved the quality of the petroleum products.
" China's domestic oil product quality standards continued to improve and the refining capacity of the refining equipment also increased.
As a result, the quality of oil products exported from China gradually reached the same level as that of Japan (the world's highest quality)," said TonenGeneral Sekiyu.
"After the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia," according to JX Energy. Such light oil products are competitive with Japanese products on the Asian market.
Although the "Japanese high quality oil" falls into a crisis, the Japanese oil companies just adopted the strategy of "exporting to profitable areas while being concerned about the market".
As China's exports of petroleum products have a huge impact on the Asian market, teapot refineries got more attentions.
2016 Liqun sunshine student support action of the Yangtze Evening News started from May 26. After two months of registration, the total number of poor students applying for grants was up to 800.
During the subsidizing process, more than RMB 1.2 million of social donations has been obtained (the detailed donations are publicized in five batches). This can help at least 240 poverty-stricken students achieve their college dream.
At present, donations continued and this newspaper called on the community to continue to lend a helping hand, so that more families with children can obtain funding and social care.
In order to ensure that the student support action is fair, open and transparent, the newspaper today announced the basic information of the students. The names of the first 100 students will be publicized today to receive the supervision of readers.
"Liqun sunshine student action" is a well-known Chinese charity brand. Yangzi Evening News Liqun sunshine student action has been initiated in Jiangsu since 2003. More than 4,000 students have been supported.
The scope of the fund covers college entrance freshmen, excluding tuition-free majors. Students qualified for the fund should have excellent study performance and family poverty.
According to the statistics bureau, the population growth of New Zealand had previously exceeded 2% only in 1974 and during the 1950s-1960s ("baby boom"), which was the peak time of birth.
New Zealand's net inflow of migrants in the 12 months ended June this year was 69,100 people, which became the main driver of New Zealand's population growth in recent years.
In addition, in the same period, New Zealand's population saw an organic increase of 28,200.
Data shows that in the recent 10 years, the average annual net inflow of immigrants in New Zealand is 21,800, with annual organic increase of 32,300 people.
From the view of population structure, a large influx of immigrants means that the ratio of "working age population" aged 15 to 39 years old gradually expanded.
As of June 2016, New Zealand's working-age population rose by 3.6 percent to 1.58 million.
At the same time, the population growth of people aged over 65 years is also 3.6%, reaching 700,000.

It is learned that the first carriage of goods of Sino-Asia freight trains are "Made in Shaanxi". And now, it has attracted a large number of foreign sources.
As of the end of July, the volume of container received for Sino-Asia freight trains reached 64,000 TEU, an increase of 8% over the same period in 2015.
With the increase of the operation of Sino-Asia freight trains, the freight volume of the Xinzhu Railway Station of Xi'an Railway Bureau increased year by year.
In 2015, the cargo throughput of the Xinzhu Railway Station of the whole year reached 2.477 million tons. As of August 10, 2016, the volume of cargo has reached 1.531 million tons, representing an increase of 6.7% over the same period last year.
In order to meet the needs of future development, the Construction Planning of Xi'an Newly Integrated Logistics Center has been introduced, with the Xi'an Xinzhu railway station as a focus, endeavoring to build a new modern railway integrated logistics park.
A mid-aged man in India won a US$1 million award this week at the Dubai International Airport, where he had just experienced an airplane belly landing shock last week.
Muhammad Bashir Abdul Hedar, who has lived in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, for a long time, has a habit of buying lottery tickets every time he returns.
His 21-year-old son suffered from paralysis due to accidental fall 13 days after his birth. He toils day in and day out to repay his son's medical expense loan.
"After escaping from the crash, I was given the second life and offered the money to allow me do the good", said Hedar.
Although now it is the beginning of autumn, the power of "afterheat" doesn't seem to be weaker at all than that in summer.
UV not only tans but also sunburns your skin, so how to enable your skin to go through the military training without sunburn?
Sunblock is generally marked with SPF and PA on the package. SPF refers to Sun Protection Function and is targeted at UVB. The common SPF indexes include 15, 30, 50, etc.
The product marked with PA is more effective against UVA. Generally, the intensity of PA is represented with +. An extra + indicates extension of effective protection time.
People with oily skin should choose water-based sunblock with a strong penetration. Sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
People with dry skin should choose creamy sunscreen. The classification of neutral skin generally has no strict rules. Any kind of skin care products are burden to the sensitive skin. So it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunblock half an hour in advance, because sunscreen products take time to be completely absorbed into the skin.
Because you are exposed to the sunshine longer during the military training, you have to apply the sunscreen products once every two hours to lengthen the effect and should never be lazy.
As the skin has just been stimulated by the sun's sake, do not immediately use whitening products after returning from military training.
After exposure under the blazing sun for quite a long time, please wrap the ice with towel to ease the sunburned skin and alleviate the local heat if condition allowed.
The cumulative subsidy policy will remain available for buying agricultural machinery during the exhibition. Farmers can obtain 40% of agricultural subsidies.
This trade show invites investment and exhibitions worldwide. In particular, it enhances the invitation on countries and target market countries related to the Belt and Road Initiative.
This exhibition strives to accomplish 60 investment signing projects, introduce 22 billion yuan of fund, sign more than 160 trade contracts, which totaled 3.2 billion Yuan.
It is reported that the reason for "Hunan Exposition" to be settled in Loudi for seven consecutive years is the strong foundation of the manufacturing industry in Loudi, Hunan, which boasted long history of industrial development.
As the host place of "Hunan Exposition", Loudi has established trade relationship with more than 90 countries around the world.
"Hunan Exposition" has become an important platform for the local place to cultivate the development of characteristic industries and promote the "going-out" of characteristic industries.
During some nights, the ionized layer is full of free electrons, which means that the radio signal can go farther.
The US Air Force was interested in copying this effect, the website of Popular Science, an American monthly magazine, reported on August 11,.
Although the stable ionizing layer with a large number of free electrons may help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station, this may not appeal to the US Air Force.
Ionization layer full of electrons indicated the radio used by the military has a larger range of broadcasts. In addition, it may prevent the global positioning system (GPS) signal from the solar storm.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellite according to the requirement. They may enhance ionization layer when necessary.
But firstly, the team that signed contract with the air force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
Industry data showed that the total size of coal production in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons and the national coal production overcapacity reached 1.8 billion tons.
Over the past decade, the State Council has issued a total of five notices for the elimination of excessive and backward production capacity.
Although the first four notices did not directly target the coal industry, the target industry is directly related to the coal industry.
From last November to this January, the price of Qinhuangdao 5,500 kcal steam coal lingered at 370 yuan/ton and 90% of the coal enterprises fell into deficits.
And since February, coal prices have gradually picked up, and Qinhuangdao steam coal prices rose continuously for four weeks, hit a 16-month high and once climbed to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan per ton compared with the beginning of this year.
With the price rising comes concerns of all walks of life: Will a number of small coal mines resume production?
In this regard, Kuang Xianming, head of the Economic Research Institute of the China (Hainan) Reform and Development Institute, conducted an analysis and interpretation.
Overcapacity reduction roused high concerns of various parties. The report on the overcapacity reduction by the coal industry announced today worried everyone indeed, according to Kuang Xianming.
These three superficial factors reflect the reason behind the relative lagging behind of our growth pattern change. That is, the government-led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed.
Second, it is also directly related to the force of local governments. During the overcapacity reduction process, the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be put into place. From this point of view, the differences are indeed relatively large among different regions.
Thirdly, some of the provinces that are relatively slow in progress may face greater risks if they seek acceleration in progress in the second half of the year.
In this case, relying on the central allowance to raise funds to promote the process of capacity reduction may have a negative impact.
First, overcapacity reduction is not a simple total quantity control.
Our goal is to eliminate the backward production capacity, promote the optimization of the structure and restructure the new format of the entire coal industry.
During the process of overcapacity reduction deployment, the local governments must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry to develop the relevant service industry.
Second, in order to complete this year's overcapacity reduction task within this year, we must give full play to the power of administrative supervision.
Finally, we should strengthen the protection role of social security.
Because the market is directly related to the employment issue, we have to strengthen the employment skills training of employees.
"The reason for the ranking decline is that Brazilian GDP growth is expected to worsen in the medium term."
In 2015, Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014.
The International Investment Attractiveness Index of Credit Suisse includes four sub-indices: infrastructure, economic outlook, business environment and direct investment.
In 2015, Brazil's international direct investment was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014 .
Last year, Brazil's "green investment" (in the investment model of building factories abroad) was $17.9 billion, a year-on-year fall of 2.1%.
"There are 288 'green land investment' projects in Brazil, with an average annual rise of 314 from 2003 to 2014".
However, in the first half of 2016, the international direct investment in Brazil had reached $33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10 per cent compared to the same period last year.
Original Title: Canadian Police Kill IS Supporters: Preparations for Homemade Bomb Downtown Attack Near the End
The taxi was dispatched to the Dreyfus before the police arrived, according to the taxi company.
Canadian police said at a news conference on Wednesday that the information received by the police included the "martyrdom video" sent by the young man to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. According to the video, the young man will strike.
According to the German voice, in the video, a man wearing a black Barakella hat is reading the "Koran", referred to the crime against Muslims, and vowed to attack a Canadian city sooner.
He said in the video, the attack will occur within 72 hours, and in the rush hour.
The incident marks the first time for the police to kill terror suspects before the occurrence of an incident since the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power last year.
The Old Wanfu River and Beidaliu branch channels of the Upgraded Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal Will Charge Tolls Since September 1.
The two tributaries will be transformed via social financing. The charges have been approved by the relevant provincial government departments.
The old Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang, Yu Tai and then through the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 32.5 km.
According to the navigation needs, the old Wanfu River channel takes the mode of conservation and transformation. Dredging was conducted on some deep-water segments and some sharp curves were cut so that the navigation conditions can be improved.
The channel flows through Jinxiang County, Rencheng District and then the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 19 km.
The renovation project of the two waterway started construction in February 2011. The delivery inspection was conducted in January 2015. The investment construction and operation main body is the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center of Jining City.
In accordance with the principle of "borrowing for construction and charging for repaying loan", the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center of Jining City will collect channel tolls according to the charge standard approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau.
Among them, the basic toll is 1.75 yuan/dwt and mileage toll is 0.05 yuan/km dwt.
The toll collection period is from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
Reporters learned from the Jining Port and Waterway Bureau that there are a total of 4 toll channels within the Jining region, including Zhushuihe Channel, Baima River Channel, Beidahang Channel and Laowanfu Channel.
These four channels are branch channels of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which were upgraded and renovated in the way of social financing.
Zhushuihe Channel Upgrade Renovation Project is the first project adopting the mode of "government + market" for the infrastructure construction of river and ports within Shandong Province. The government accounts for the major part of investment while social fund fills the funding gap.
Baima River, Laowanfu River, Beidaliu River and other feeder routes adopt a pure market operation.
The funds allocated by the national finance cannot meet the needs of the project construction and restrict the progress of the channel upgrade.
Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure are in line with national policy requirements and have become a way to break the bottleneck of funding.
Ning Zetao's performance in the 100 meters freestyle semi-final has made a lot of Chinese audience speechless.
Ning Zetao once again exceeded people's "base line" in the 50-meter freestyle preliminary.
Actually, this 50-meter freestyle is not the strength of Ning Zetao. His performance and best achievement in Kazan World Championships also indicated that it is not possible for him to make breakthrough in this project.
Sure enough, Ta Kung Pao, an authoritative media in Hong Kong, revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao to lose is that he has lost interest in swimming.
Many factors may have a great impact on his future ideas. He is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle.
After Kazan World Championships, Ning Zetao immediately became a celebrity with his good look and excellent performance.
As a result, "national husband (a good match)", "young fresh meat", "Adonis", etc. became his labels continuously.
A variety of business activities came to him. A good fortune has offered him a golden flashing prospect.
In this case, that Ning Zetao chooses to withdraw and joins the entertainment circle, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable way.
After all, he is only 23 years old. After some study, he can star in some TV series with his popularity.
But Ning Zetao needs to see whether he is qualified enough compared with his predecessors.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, the already 21-year-old Liu Xuan came to the end of his athlete career.
The stylish appearance of Liu Xuan impressed people and also laid a foundation for her to join the entertainment circle.
After retirement, Liu Xuan starred in a number of TV series, and set up her own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in the single and double ten-meter match of two Olympic Games, and won 2 gold and 2 silver.
But when he was defeated by his counterpart Hu Jia at the 10-meter single match in the 2004 Olympic Games, Tian Liang's competitive state slipped and it was said he was dismissed by the diving team.
But when he took along his daughter to participate in the variety show "Dad, Where Are We Going?" he became a focus.
The once gold generation including Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing all participated in various forms of variety show.
It is worth mentioning that, Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng led the Chinese team and won champion in the 2008 Olympic Games men's team. Yang Wei even got his individual all-around gold medal twice and was called as the Almighty King.
And Chen Yibing has become a hoisting ring king while leading his team to win the championship in the 2012 Olympic Games men's team.
But after he was misjudged and lost the gold in the Rondon Olympic Games, his magnanimous act won him so many funs.
However, these game players mainly focus on the venue, they just touch and then go at the variety show.
However, no matter whether they are retired or active athletes, they need to provide outstanding performance to win in the entertainment circle.
After all, athletes have just stepped into a new area, so it is just a blank state for them in case of capabilities and connection.
Even for Tian Liang and Liu Xuan, who are not new in the entertainment circle, common people always think of their performance at the Olympic Games when mentioning them.
And the introduction of Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng at the variety show is always Olympic Games Champion.
Compared with these people, the title of Ning Zetao, a swimming world championship, is not so great.
Moreover, compared with the withdrawal of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan and Yang Wei, etc. at their peaks, the withdrawal of Ning Zetao at 23 after some setback would cause immeasurable effects to the negative influence of his image.
After all, at the mention of athletes, they are required to be "not all-time success but no fear of danger". Ning Zetao lags far behind from this point.
At the very least, Ning Zetao can totally rely on his great looks to win the support of thousands of fans.
It is a lot more difficult to be famous in the entertainment circle by just relying on good appearance than training.
You have to listen to your inner voice on your life path. But as for how to choose, Ning Zetao should be quite conscious.
On the surface, the online social platform expands our social circle and reduces people's loneliness.
The sphere of influence of social networking not only replaces the traditional telephone contact, but also gets down to the offline living circle, quietly changing the current social life.
The benefits of online social network are obvious, convenient and quick, so it is particularly favored by young people.
A survey of college students' social habits showed that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours on mobile phone and are almost inseparable to mobile phones during their daily lives.
"Social network features low cost, fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication among several people. This meets the requirement of modern college students."
Expanding the interpersonal relationship circle, more equal dialogue, avoiding social concerns are the major reasons for us to be fascinated with online chat.
New comers in the company love online exchange with colleagues. "We are not familiar with each other when we just come to the company. The likes and comments on social platform links people closer. "

"People of different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speech. Various social concerns during real life may be eliminated immediately on internet."
However, Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, thought that Wu Yan is a "very boring otaku."
Xiaopeng and Wuyan met each other in the group chatting. They two get familiar with each other because they are active speakers.
Xiaopeng thought that Wuyan is quite different from the one on internet. He is quite bored and does not take the initiative to express his views. His words are repeated like this, "Oh, yes, right", or "I will check it online".

"At that time, it was too urgent. And there was just one idea in my heart, which was to rescue people!" Huang Yilin said when receiving a phone call interview from the journalist on August 11 after getting back to her Mianyang home.
Huang Yilin was a student of grade 2015 in the Landscape Architecture College of Central South University of Forestry and Technology.
Majored in urban and rural planning, Huang Yilin wanted to visit Langzhong, Sichuan, and learn the local architectural designs, so the family left for there.
At around 10 a.m. on August 8th, Huang Yilin's father was having a rest in the hotel, while Huang Yilin and his mother went to stroll in the Langzhong ancient city.
Having not walked far, they saw a group of people shouting, so they approached for curiosity.
Seeing that "the little boy has disappeared, and the little girl was desperately fluttered in the water just with her little head above the water and was sinking", Huang Yilin, who learned how to swim in her childhood hurriedly jumped down to rescue them.
After jumping into the water, the 165cm-tall Huang Yilin found that she cannot touch the bottom!
The calm-looking river had rapids in the bottom.
But she still desperately swam to the little girl.
Huang Yilin said the river was muddy and flowed fast. The only 5-meter distance almost wore her out.
She tried her best to push the little girl to the embankment. "The slope was particularly slippery, and I was afraid that I had no strength but to sink."
So Huang Yilin called to her mother for help. Hearing her daughter's call, Ms. Yin, who was not good at swimming, tried to get down to the water for rescue and was held back by other people.
On August 10, after the spread of the news of Huang Yilin's jumping into the river for rescue, Ms. Yin received the condolences and compliments of a lot of friends and relatives as well as the "concerns" of many relatives and friends.
"Now, in retrospect, it's really terrible! Frankly speaking, when my child did not hold on to the riverbank, my heart was almost broken."
Ms. Yin said with a lingering fear that, despite the danger, she will still support her daughter's choice and she is proud of her daughter even if she was placed in that scene again!
Because she was forced to learn swimming, she seldom went to swim after mastering the skill. "I did not expect this skill really to come in handy."
According to Chen Yiyang, her monitor, Huang Yilin is the "Straight A Student" recognized by her classmates and is always ready to help others.

As a Party cadre, Sun Fujian lost his ideal and belief, seriously broke the discipline of the CPC, and still didn't constrain himself from serious wrong doings after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In addition, he was not astringent and broke the rules. Such deed was vile and grave indeed.
After the occurrence of this case and a number of media reports, this has become the focus of the case, with extremely bad social impact.
After the case, Haikou City Public Security Bureau of Interpol detachment leaders attached great importance and immediately organized a detachment of elite troops to take the initiative to investigate.
The police immediately pursued and attacked the suspect on the internet and took a variety of measures to control. In addition, the police contacted their colleagues of other cities to investigate the whereabouts of Wang.
As the suspect was a stealing recidivism and repeatedly dealt with the public security organs, he had strong anti-reconnaissance capabilities. In addition, due to his long-term drug abuse, the frequent drug addiction strikes made trial work quite difficult.
Greenland sharks are also known as small head sleeping sharks, widely distributed in Greenland and the North Atlantic waters around Iceland. It has the length of 4 to 5 meters in their adult age.
But their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 cm a year, suggesting that Greenland shark may have an extra-long life.
Traditional dating methods usually use calcified tissue of animals. Some fins can use fins, but this calcified tissue is very scarce in Greenland sharks.
A new study led by Julius Nelson of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, turned to the use of Greenland shark's ocular lens for radioactive carbon dating.
This method had previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it is the first time to be used to determine the age of sharks and other fish.
Their analysis showed that the life span of the largest shark was estimated at 392 years old, with a deviation of 120 years old.
That is to say, this shark is aged at least 272 years old. The maximum age may be 512 years old.
In addition, the female Greenland shark is alleged to be sexually matured at about 4 meters in length. That is, it cannot reach adulthood until the age of 156 at least.
The researchers thus wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark was known as the vertebrate with the longest life span on the Earth, surpassing the age of the previous longevity champion black right whale (211 years).
Ihe exchange reform results in the past year were significant, with RMB exchange rate remaining basically stable, and laid foundation for promoting the internationalization of RMB.
From the view of market performance, in the year, the two-way floating characteristics of the RMB exchange rate was outstanding. The elasticity of exchange is expected to be strengthened and the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable.
Ever since the exchange reform, the fluctuation of RMB against the US dollar often appears, with ups and downs during the process.
Last year, the last remittance reform measure before the "8.11" exchange rate reform was carried out in 2005. The appreciation of yuan against the US dollar was significant during the last 10 years.
Since the implementation of the new exchange reform, the previous appreciation state of RMB was changed. The central parity rate of the RMB exchange rate in one year was about 8%.
This October 1, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the yuan, which will become SDR weight currency.
This week, the statistics released by China's General Administration of Customs showed that in the first 7 months of this year, China's import and export volume was RMB 13.21 trillion, down 3% over the same period last year.
In July, China's total import and export volume fell by only 0.9% year on year. In particular, China's export value had a year-on-year rise of 2.9%.
Relevant experts believed that despite the signs of stabilization in July, we should not have high expectations.
In July, China's total import and export volume was RMB 2.09 trillion, a year-on-year fall of 0.9%.
Among them, the export was valued RMB 1.22 trillion, up 2.9%; the import was valued RMB 873 billion, down 5.7%; trade surplus was valued RMB 342.8 billion, with an increase of 34%.
Although the total value of imports and exports fell year on year, the export data saw the fifth consecutive month of growth since March this year.
Shanghai police captured more than 3,400 thieves and combated 157 "robbery fraud" gangs in 4 months
While detecting the case at the same time, the police also pressed for payments and recovered stolen goods totaling more than 33 million yuan.
According to the theft gang members, they came to Shanghai via chartering unlicensed taxies. Then they got off the taxies and commit crimes and gathered and took taxies several hours later. Finally, they left Shanghai together.

In late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the 6th African Development Conference, according to the Evening News Peak of Voice of China.
The African Development Conference was dominated by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo, Japan or Yokohama, so this meeting will be the first move to Africa.
This African conference will help draw attentions of African and European countries to Japan, according to Japanese Foreign Ministry officials.
In line with the trip of Shinzo Abe, according to the Kyodo news agency, the Japanese Liberal Democrats will send parliamentary groups to the countries concerned.
Japan's "application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council" began in the early 90s of the last century while the African-sponsored African Development Conference also began in 1993. This is not a coincidence.
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations and is therefore an important ticket bunker of the United Nation. How can Japan give up Africa if it wants to join the United Nations Security Council?
It will also exchange views with national stakeholders on the extreme organization of "Islamic State" and terrorist activities.
"Western Group" will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea Bissau.
Fumio Kishida, the current Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan, has also recently stated the intentions of the African Development Conference at the UN Security Council.
Abe has announced here that in order to stabilize sub-Saharan African countries, it will provide 100 billion yen (about RMB 6.1 billion) in five years.
Observers generally believe that there are two purposes behind Japan's generosity toward Africa: first, to increase Japan's presence in Africa; second, to win the support of African countries on the application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
"In terms of politics, Africa is relatively lagging behind, but there are many African countries. So Japan has always regarded it as the so-called 'big ticket field,'" said Yang Bojiang, an expert for Japanese issues.
Japan will not give up in the future and its work on Africa will not be terminated but gradually strengthened.
Economically, Japan enjoys a strong production capacity, but its domestic market is relatively limited. In particular, the domestic demand is relatively weak in the context of aging population.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi, who was Japan's prime minister 10 years ago, to the present Abe, Japan has repeatedly launched the "sprint" scheme. However, all schemes were abandoned eventually.
The intension of Japan to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is clear at a glance. However, the road is bound to be full of obstacles, according to Yang Bojiang.
To achieve its own goals, Japan should firstly get along with the surrounding countries. And Japan needs to have a correct attitude in geopolitical competition, national dispute or understanding of a historical problem.

The enthusiasm of Mexican audiences left a deep impression on Fu Jia, the young actress of lady white.
"It never occurred to me that the Mexican audiences were so enthusiastic. I had some worries about whether they could understand the story, but it was beyond my expectation to see them master the story content and their laughter today.
Qiu Xiaoqi, the Chinese ambassador to Mexico, said that the various cultural exchange activities of this year's "Sino-Latin American Cultural Exchange Year" promoted the two peoples to deepen mutual understanding and enhance their friendship.
The 45th anniversary for the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mexico will occur the next year. By then there will be more cultural exchange activities held in China and Mexico.

From the women's team coach to the men's team coach, to the head coach, Huang Yubin created an "Olympic gold group", and led to win 9 gold, 1 silver and 4 copper at the Beijing Olympic Games.
Since then, Tian Liang has been repeatedly acting as an advertising endorser. He has even served as a "Cowherd", "Lei Feng" and other important roles in recent years.
Many NBA players have proved their strength. But whenever there is progress, there is a setback.
Whether it is because of the increase in age or limit in playing time, there were always some players having worse performance each season.
Of course, some "setbacks" may only be data shrink and the strength of these players may not have been reduced.
Even if Wade is still one of the league's best linebacker, his performance in the Bulls is not so good as that of the Miami Heat.
The backcourt range of he and Rondo is limited. The three-point hit rate of headed star Butler is just 32.8%, making their next-season offence quite congested.
After coming to Windy City, Wade will definitely pass the ball to Butler and Rondo and he himself chose to play healthy in the regular games.
Okafor's situation is a bit embarrassing. As the first choice of the 76ers last season, he had to compete for playing time and ball right with Simmons and Embiid in the new season.
This competition may not come soon. Simmons also needs to adapt to the NBA stadium, and Embiid must also be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can have a position in the long array of the 76ers remains a question.
Last season, 32% of the score of Okafor came from low position attacks. The ratio is higher than Cousins, Vukcevic and Brook Lopez, while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league.
With Simmons already showing a good point-forward potential, Embiid also has a better stature more suitable for NBA games and Okafor's position is hard to be so solid.
Over the past two seasons, Thompson's use rate has stabilized in the top 20 of the league and this is the best two seasons for his career.
But the problem is, with the arrival of Durant, Thompson's appearance rate will surely decline, which is bound to affect his play.
This effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots, Thompson's holding attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced, which in some ways will reduce the opponent's defense difficulty.
Durant's arrival will certainly negatively affect the score of Warriors players, but the one with the most negative effect is probably that of Thompson.
But this does not mean that the level of Thompson steps backward. This is more likely that he made sacrifice for the team as a whole.
Parker had a better performance than last season. This is not only because his basket efficiency came to the highest level, his chemical reaction with Aldrich also benefits the Spurs.
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced a second battle in a year and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end. As one of the youngest among three people, the oil tank of French sports car is not much left.
After getting the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular MVP than that of James, while Jordan was the only one who had more FMVP than that of James.
Oh, yes, James has just brought the first professional sports championship trophy in Cleveland in the past 52 years.
Coming to the 14th season of his career, James needs to better conserve his strength and get ready for the playoffs.
Therefore, in the regular season, James's capability is likely to further decline. He will share more with Owen, but he will still easily become one of the league's top three players.
"I must carry forward what I learned in China to apply it to Russia".
Huang Jing, chairman of the Moscow Overseas Chinese Association said excitedly on the 12th day of the month of the local time while she was interviewed by a reporter of Chinanews.com.
Not long ago, she participated in the "Overseas Chinese culture community Chinese talent (calligraphy/painting) training" hosted by China's State Council Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and sponsored by Jinan University.
At the beginning of her participation in the training course, she did not know where to start in painting and calligraphy. But at the end of the course, she could draw and write her own works.
After returning to Moscow, I will use the knowledge and skills learned in China to Russia and make my own contribution for the cultural transmission and promotion of the Chinese culture.
At the same time, Na Yanwei, Secretary-General of Russian-Chinese Culture Promotion Association, also participated in the training course and had the same feeling.
She said that she made great progress with the help of teachers of the training classes and she felt the heavy responsibility of being an "overseas communicator of Chinese culture".
She said, after she came back to Russia, she would surely carry out the traditional Chinese culture among the Chinese and the Russian peoples who love Chinese culture.

This was also the first time for Kardec to score in the games of the Chinese Football Association Super League. Lifan leads by 2:0.
Just at the beginning of the next half, Fernando won a free kick on the right side with an abrupt breakthrough. It was a pity that he kicked the ball too high in small angle and missed the goal.

Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.
But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.
It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
It has been some journey for GB.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost just one.
This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.
Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.
It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.
With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.
12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.
A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.
On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.
Which is pretty much how it is.
GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.
Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.
The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.
Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, it was touch and go.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
If they don't it goes everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It alters your outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.
That's how it starts off.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."
It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well.
It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.
Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in the moment.
Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.
The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," she said.

Bulgaria Posts Inflation for 1st Time in 8 Months
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July, national statistics show.
This is the highest value in years (since June 2012) and the first one above zero since October of last year when a positive 0.2% was posted.
The annual average inflation, measured by CPI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furnishings, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."
And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.
Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.
It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says
Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.
The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown With Britain
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.
"I have no clue," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.
The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.
Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.
The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.
"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She is on a roll.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.
"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.
In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.
As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
He was fabulously out of touch.
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."
Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."
There was the cream-puff incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
It is a pity that OPEC's latest monthly report shows that the crude oil production in July continued to increase and Saudi Arabia's output hit a new high.
The report cannot prevent the market from doubting the credibility of OPEC. The oil price recovery path is still filled with thorns.
On Monday, OPEC President Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry Mohammed Saleh al-Sada said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting at the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
The monthly report of OPEC released on Wednesday showed that the July output of the entire OPEC organization, including Gabon, increased by 46,000 barrels/day to 33.11 million barrels/day.
OPEC also said in the monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil, thus aggravating the excessive market supply.
Affected by this news, coupled with the production output expectations of the rising crude oil production volume and the unexpected increase in crude oil inventories, international oil prices fell for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday's closing, the futures price of light crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 2.48% while Rondon Brent's price for October crude oil futures fell by 2.07%.
According to Reuters, the proposed meeting of the oil-producing countries is unlikely to tighten the supply. The data released by the US Energy Information Administration also dampens the market.
Iran's official news agency Fars quoted on Wednesday the speech of Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh as saying that Iran's daily crude oil production was up to 3.85 million barrels, which is the highest level since 2008.
As soon as the release of the news of the meeting, Russian Energy Minister Novak said that it was unnecessary to conduct a new round of production freezing negotiations under the current oil price.
It was April when the oil-producing countries had the last meeting. No agreement was reached among the OPEC member countries for relevant meaures.
The market and the media could overreact to OPEC's meeting, according to Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMI Research.
OPEC changed the market sentiment by releasing signals that they would reach an agreement, said Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at Royal Bank of Canada.
Such a means is just like smoke and mirror that draw people's attention (which deliberately gives a false impression).
It is deemed very unlikely by people that OPEC tries to stabilize the market through the September meeting, according to Eugen Weinberg, director of commodity research at Commerzbank.
This will probably further undermine the market confidence in OPEC. After all, this organization already staged a "wolf is coming" performance.
All the local authorities should make medical institutions which have had illegal medical advertising, received complaints frequently or been repeatedly punished as the focus of their random inspection.
The National Health and Family Planning Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will timely carry out supervision and examination on the supervision and inspection work of some provinces.
According to media disclosure, the large-scale flow of capital into the Internet medicine sector has resulted in the current serious problem of product homogeneity. Investment boom faded gradually and capital came into the wait-and-see period.
In addition, according to the data of the Hong Kong Institute of Asclepius Hospital Management, a large number of start-up Internet medical companies languished within one year and about 20% of the start-up Internet medical companies have ceased to exist.
However, just as the majority of Internet medical companies struggle on the way of A round or B round of financing, several segment-leading enterprises can still be favored by investors.
It seems that the Internet medical business shall not be blinded. Instead, it should take into account the needs of the market, and should be professional and dedicated.
Yuyue invested RMB 12 million, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, while Jiuzhoutong invested RMB 18 million, accounting for 60% of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the national policy support for medical information construction, electronic integrated supply chain management systems have gradually been introduced to hospitals at all levels.
The cooperation between Yuyue and Jiuzhoutong is aimed at the needs of the market, helping the hospital to build an advanced supply chain management system, and take this opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies which go in for grandiose projects, iBaby focuses on the Internet obstetrics vertical field and be dedicated to pregnant mothers and doctors.
Pregnant women can not only enjoy 24 hours of medical services free of charge and one-on-one inquiry with doctors, but also enjoy paid medical counseling.
At the doctor's side, iBaby breaks the geographical restrictions by taking the form of organizing experts to give grassroots doctors an online lecture, peer exchange, case discussion and so on.
At present, three sectors are set up for doctor's client side, i.e. continuing education, social exchange and communication.
Services including online learning, case discussion, academic exchange, social platforms for the exchange of doctors of the same hospital and department, legal assistance and business support required by doctor-patient relationship or personal life are provided.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali Health "is willing to get down" to win big health data.
Internet companies and data companies are short of professionalism. No unity can be provided even on the wording of the same entry.
The layout of Ali in the medical and health field is divided into three parts, namely, Ali Health, Yaotmall.com and Alipay Future Hospital.
Wang Lei admitted that it was more difficult for medical and health companies to start up than other industries, "This is not just how much money you have. In addition, it requires people to be concentrated on it and endure the loneliness. "
Staying up late watching the Olympic Games will damage the heart easily
The Brazil Olympic Games is in full swing. Even if the event is broadcast in the midnight in China, many people will stay up late to watch.
In this regard, a doctor reminded that staying up late has health risks and may lead to cardiovascular diseases.
If you stay up for a long time, a great amount of hormone will be secreted and your body will continue to be in a state of intense excitement and cannot have normal recovery. This may easily cause vasoconstriction and blood pressure rise and then cardiovascular disease.
Han Zhiyuan specially reminded people with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits, family history and other cardiovascular risk factors that they may easily suffer from cardiovascular diseases if staying up late.
If you stay up late, then your cardiovascular function will be affected, your gastrointestinal function, immune system and neuroendocrine system will also be affected, and even the risk of cancer will increase.
For old people, Han Zhiyuan suggested that they would better not stay up late to watch games, particularly those with cardiovascular diseases.
During the last "World Cup" football match, Han Zhiyuan received a 60-year-old patient. His onset of myocardial infarction may be related to staying up late to watch games.
According to Han Zhiyuan, his department had treated some 25-year-old myocardial infarction or stroke patients. This is largely due to staying up late for a long time.
1. Do not stay up late every day. You can occasionally stay up all night watching the favorite sports and watch the rebroadcast for other sports the next day.
2. You may drink more water, have more fruit during staying up as this can prevent blood clogging and enhance your body immunity.

The film is expected to premiere on CCTV and Letv early next year. A VR panoramic documentary version will also be launched for the first time.
The documentary "Extreme Road" is a large-scale work that focuses on the world's third pole, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It tells a story for the integration of Tibetan tradition and the modern world and the interaction between Tibet and the world from a new perspective.
The biggest advantage for VR works is to enable the audience to have a unique movie watching "immersion"sense and this also leads to a higher request for the shooting process.
The production team of the "Extreme Road" Panorama VR special edition said that they will ensure that every viewing angle is impeccable and let the audiences feel as if they are personally on the scene.
On August 11, the Yantai detachment of Shandong Armed Police Corps organized special war snipers to have jungle training in Kunyu Mountain under the high temperature of 34 degrees Celsius.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union transported missiles to Cuba, which almost led to the US-Soviet Union nuclear war.
This event was seen as the climax of the cold war, known as the "Cuban missile crisis".
But what is little known is that during the Cold War, a strong solar storm has almost led to a nuclear war of the United States against the Soviet Union. The incident was not been announced by researchers until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused strong interference to the radar and radio communications of the US military force in the Arctic.
These radars were part of the ballistic missile early warning system of the US, used for monitoring Soviet missiles.
This paper was written by researchers at the University of Colorado, who interviewed US military personnel involved in the forecasting and analysis of solar activity and reviewed non-confidential documents.
The paper said that in the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching a nuclear war, the US Air Force has always had some fighters flying in the sky with nuclear warheads.
US military commanders did not know that the chief culprit of the interference was the solar storm rather than the Soviet Union, so they ordered the fighters to enter combat readiness state.
Fortunately, the US military force had started the study of solar activities and its electromagnetic interference to the Earth since the 1950s, it ultimately stopped this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the US Air Force Air Weather Service and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequences of this solar storm was that the US military has seen space weather as a combat concern since then and has built a stronger space weather forecast system.
During routine travel, when citizens found that their cars were blocked by a strange vehicle and they failed to contact with the vehicle driver, they may use "WeChat vehicle moving" function to solve this problem.
On August 11, the Xi'an traffic police's WeChat service account "Xi'an traffic police" launched the "WeChat vehicle moving" service.
After the launching of this service, during daily life, when the citizens found their cars were blocked by unfamiliar vehicles, the drivers of which are not at the scenes, they may solve the problems via the "WeChat" function.
The new service function has many advantages: first of all, it is fast and can save administrative costs; secondly, it respects and protects the privacy of citizens; and thirdly, it is all-weather, around-the-clock service.
Citizens can operate on it quite conveniently with their WeChat. Such a method enables the both sides to "meet" in a friendly and easy way and alleviates and solves the problem of difficulty of parking and reduces the occurrence rate of car-related public security cases.
On the other hand, for those who refuse to move and have illegal parking or obstruction, the Xi'an traffic control department said the traffic police will take different measures to handle based on the actual situation.
More than 10 young workers of Shangluo Power Supply Company came to the Dihua town cultural tourism scenic spots of Danfeng County to launch activities for the "electricity introduction in the ancient town" and Double Seventh Festival themes on August 9.
Shangluo Power Supply Company's Danfeng County branch works with the construction of spiritual civilization, and actively organizes the "electricity introduction in the ancient town" and Double Seventh Festival theme activities.
"We spend most of our time on work and study, so we lack time and platform to chat with my colleagues and friends," said staff members who participated in the activities.
"This time the company provided us with such a relaxed, happy and harmonious platform. I really like it. It's meaningful and interesting."
Double Seventh Festival theme activities have won wide acclaim from youth staff at the scene. They hope that the company would later organize such activities, and strengthen communication and exchange more with other young people.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly issued a new version of "US-Japan defense cooperation guidelines" in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role in the world.
US Defense Secretary Carter, US Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Japanese Minister of Defense Gen Nakatani attended the press conference in New York on that day.
This is the fifth time that China's civilian think tank has published the Japanese military assessment report and the fourth issue of the English version.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including overall policy adjustment, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, military system reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation and military security relations with China and so on.
According to the report, the year 2015 is the last year of the Abe government's multiple-year push to promote major policy adjustments in the security field.
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the field of security will be mainly in the legal system, strategy implementation, policy implementation and other operational levels, rather than the substantial adjustments and changes of framework, mechanisms and policies.
The report emphasized that the Abe Cabinet tried to achieve the promotion of Japan's "state normalization" via the above-mentioned three breakthroughs and the going-out of militia to intervene in international security affairs, strengthen the Japan-US alliance, prevent the rise of China and restrain China.
Previously, the China Strategy Culture Promotion Association had released such Japanese military assessment reports on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014 and June 30, 2015.
The UK-based Financial Times on August 12 released a group of pictures on mansion of the US ambassador to China.

The mansion is gray and strongly fortified with peripheral fence, second interior wall, barbed wire entanglement and vehicle roadblocks.
The Supplement of Public Sports Facilities
A dark coal yard warehouse is turned into a "green grass" football field while red brick spire plant is turned into a modern stadium.
Nanluo Maying Sports Culture Park, located outside the Hangzhou Wangjiang gate, unveiled its mysterious veil on the national fitness day.
It was once a coal yard and had been idle for more than 10 years after its closure. A large number of illegal construction and garbage were left behind.
After the renovation, it became a sports and cultural park, and will be officially opened in November to the public free of charge to provide sports venues. In addition, it would undoubtedly open up a new sports venue for the national sports.
This reminds people of Hangzhou Chen Jinglun Sports School, which is a "Whampoa Military Academy" in China's swimming world, giving birth to several world champions.
Swimming champions will be produced continuously, producing a vivid interpretation of the relationship between competitive sports and national sports. The profound mass base will be good for selecting professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the national foundation of sports. Athletic sports depend in a certain sense on the national sports, and the national sports depend on the conditions of the venues .
According to reports, as of 2015, China's per capita area of sports venues has been 150 times of that when the new China was established, but still far lagged behind the world sports powers.
The State Council issued the "National Fitness Program (2016 - 2020)" and took the development of mass sports as a key content this June.
In order to make up for the weakness, on the one hand, the relevant departments shall take full account of the distribution of the stadiums in urban planning.
On the other hand, the already built public sports venues, including sports venues in schools and other organizations, should try to expand the scope of openness and try to improve efficiency as much as possible.
The Rio Olympic Games, which is being held, is rousing people's enthusiasm for sports and their sense of participation as well.
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, a U.S. district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
In a filing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.
"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.
Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
It is in itself a great shame.
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.
That needs no explanation.
We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
"Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.
The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.
It adds that the code was now added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.
Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money.
Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.
They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."
We all as a team came together in the last three months.
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
The team event is always the best.
You get to win it with your mates.
It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.
He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.
After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.
After the little baby came to this world, Mom and Dad shall be responsible for his life, not only for his health, but also his spirit development, i.e. education.
If such education failed, then no matter how successful the parent's career is, one cannot make up for the shortcomings of life and family failure.
When a new baby is born, the new parents need to spend time in taking care of and educating it, and be responsible for it.
And responsibility is not only reflected in the care of body, making them healthy, but also the education of spirit. That is, to make children learn how to behave, grow up and succeed.
High-quality family education means that parents often need to accompany their children, take care of them patiently and teach them develop a civilized behavior and make them learn knowledge better and enhance intelligence.
Parents' words and deeds will affect the growth of their children because they will imitate their parents. And that is the so called, "like father, like son".
So the parent need to be a good example in front of children, regulate our words, cultivate our characters, which will indirectly help children shape their own excellent character and make them more excellent.
Amy is a smart and pretty girl.
She is outgoing and can get along well with friends. In addition, she can adapt to the environment quite well.
However, Amy has a little secret: she cannot concentrate long on study and work assignment.
This secret has accompanied Amy for a long time. Usually the problem is not so serious.
She can complete the task basically, and achieve good results even though she learns and works in decentralized and modular time.
However, when the task is heavy and pressing, Amy feels very painful and torturous.
The individual's resistance to self-exposure and his emotional experience is to prevent the individual's self-awareness and self-esteem from threatening.
And some behaviorist psychologists regard the resistance as an individual's disobedience to their behavioral corrections.
I tried to let Amy do an exercise, that is, to breathe relaxedly to calm down and feel the torment.
And she felt relaxed and regained freedom once leaving the trapped situation.
The 63-year-old tramp Han and another tramp Xiao had a dispute after drinking alcohol. Then Han stabbed Xiao to death with a knife.
According to Han, he and the tramp Xiao lived in the same lane of Dongcheng District. The two were just 20 meters apart.
On the day of the crime, the two were asked by a friend to drink alcohol. And the two had disputes during and after the meal, respectively.
He was afraid that Xiao may hit him, so he picked up a fruit knife from the garbage pile and stabbed him to death.
At the court, the victim's family asked Han to compensate for a total of 530,000 yuan in the name of funeral expenses and compensation for death.
Uber caused a big impact on the local traditional taxi industry four years after joining the Taiwanese market.
According to the information of Taiwan's "United Daily News" on August 12, more than 100 taxies drove around Taiwan Executive Yuan for protest in the morning. This resulted in a serious traffic tie-up in the surrounding area.
It has been four years since the arrival of Uber in Taiwan, but the authorities did not launch any meeting until the end of this month. This made drivers cannot wait any more, said Zheng Lijia, chairman of Taipei Driver Union.
However, the government failed to keep faith and delayed again and again.
The law-abiding taxi drivers, who are at the bottom of the society, had to compete with the unrestrained Uber and felt that they were deceived by the authorities.
Original title: The Owner of A Jiangsu Farm Was Punished Because He Sold the 2,000 Hens Which Were Checked And Detained by the Court Without Permission
After the verdict came into effect, the person surnamed Li did not voluntarily fulfill the obligation determined by the verdict, so another person surnamed Wang applied for enforcement to the Shuyang court.
On October 16, 2014, the Shuyang court made a civil ruling, which ruled that all of the 2,000 farm laying hens shall be seized and shall not be transferred or sold without permission.
After receiving the distrain ruling, Li sold some of the egg laying hens without the permission of the Shuyang court.
On March 8, 2015, when Shuyang County's Public Security Bureau came for an inspection, there were only 142 layers on the farm.
Journalists learned on August 12 that the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games issued a notice that the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games would inherit the emblem and signs and other intellectual property rights of the Bid Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.

The head of the Department of Industrial Coordination of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out today that iron and steel overcapacity becomes a global problem.
China's capacity utilization in recent years was higher than the global average, and also higher than that of countries like the United States and those in Europe.
China has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity, and the achievements are gradually made.
The CPC Central Committee and the State Council attached great importance to the global problem of iron and steel overcapacity, according to the person in charge.
All departments and regions have actively implemented the deployment of the State Council, earnestly carried out the work, and reduced crude steel production capacity by 45 million tons this year.
In view of China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports. Instead, it takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The person in charge stressed that the international trade of iron and steel products was essentially a market behavior and an independent choice due to the requirement of importing countries and after considering the product cost and other factors.
The implementation of trade protection measures cannot help fundamentally solve the global steel industry development problems. On the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order.
When it comes to debt, the person in charge stressed that the resolution of the debt problem is to properly handle the important issues that need proper handling.
As the iron and steel enterprises are large-scale and involve a wide range of enterprises and the debt relationship is complex, it may lead to regional risks if disposed of improperly.
In recent years, with the increasing economic downward pressure, the total social demand gradually weakened, the utilization of some industry capacity decreased and enterprise production, operation and management difficulties increased, according to the person in charge.
Some enterprises find it difficult for them to sustain and some of them are even on the brink of collapse due to their failure to adapt to the market changes. However, restrained by some institutional factors, they are unable to withdraw and become "zombie enterprises"
The existence of these companies distorted the market signals, reduced the element resources utilization efficiency, increased the cost of social management, thereby hindering the establishment of a market environment based on fair competition.
The main reasons for the loss are the same as the dilemma confronted by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low capacity utilization rate.
China mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law approaches. The government is mainly doing the work of providing primary protection to workers and keeping social stability to ensure a fair and equitable market order.
The person in charge stressed that the next step is to do a good job to ensure overcapacity reduction and ensuring the achievement of the objective of reducing 100-150 million tons of crude steel production capacity within five years.
On the afternoon of the 10th day of the month, the appearance of Chinese tourism police at the Red Square in Moscow immediately drew people's attention. Chinese tourists waved with surprise, and the local people and foreign tourists cannot help but stopping and looking back.
On the same day, China's first professional tourism police team - members of the Tourism Police Detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Sanya City, Hainan Province, came to the Red Square in Moscow for experience exchange and study with the local tourism police on duty.
Moscow tourism police are divided into three groups for patrol at the Red Square, Nicolieski Pedestrian Street and Gum Department Store. The Chinese tourism police followed them for study. The whole process lasted for more than an hour.
Liu Xinie, an female police officer who is over 20 years old, is proficient in English and Spanish. She just joined the tourism police team last year.
He carefully observed every word and action of his Russian counterpart and communicated with her from time to time.
The Moscow tourism police explained to the visitors with fluent Spanish whenever a Spanish tourist came for consultation. This greatly impressed Wang Bing.
"Every Moscow tourism policeman masters a foreign language, and some even can speak more than two languages, which impressed us a lot."
"Hainan, as an international tourist island, is gradually paying attention to attracting international tourists. We hope to improve their ability to match the status of the international tourism island."
Before the study, the Chinese tourism police also went to the brigade station of Moscow city police to communicate with their Russian counterparts that day.
"I often answer questions of Chinese tourists and I am very happy to see them travel to Russia."
"Their usual questions are: How to get to somewhere? Where a certain monument is? How to rent a taxi and how to return to the hotel."
Lei Sakov, the brigade captain of the Moscow city police said that in recent years, Moscow's urban environment and tourism ambience have become better and better, attracting more and more foreign tourists.
In order to meet the needs of tourism development, a tourism police team was established in July 2014 to be responsible for patrol in the major scenic spots, thus helping and guiding the tourists.
At present, all Moscow tourism policemen are proficient in English and some also master Spanish and German.
The police brigade divided them into nine groups according to their foreign language levels. They have two classes per week, learning self-defense moves, laws, regulations and foreign languages.
"At present, there are two tourism policemen beginning to learn Chinese and they can speak fluently. We have to continue to improve their Chinese level," Lysakov said.
Lysakov told reporters that the Moscow Tourism Police has accumulated experience since its inception. He hoped this will inspire his counterparts in Sanya.
He believes that the cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police departments will enhance the security sense of their citizens to each other's national tourism.
"The recruiting, police mode and equipment of Moscow tourism police officers and their excellent interactions with visitors have inspired us a lot." Chen Xiaokun said.
Detailed rules for the implementation of residence permit have been issued by at least nine provinces and cities, i.e. Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing, according to journalists of chinanews.com.
The above regions generally stipulated that applicants for the residence permit shall live locally for more than six months and meet one of these three requirements: having legitimate and stable employment, having legal and stable residence and having conditions for continuous study.
In the aspect of conveniences brought by residence permit, the "gold content" is different in various cities. Compared with the national provisions, some areas have provided more public services and conveniences, according to Chinanews.com journalists.
These areas have increased the conveniences for children to attend the college entrance examination locally after meeting the related requirements.
In addition, it is clearly proposed by Beijing and other places that they will gradually expand the scope of public services and conveniences, and regularly release the new scope to the community.
For example, Fujian proposed to announce the public services and conveniences for residence permit holders to the public at least every 3 years.
The Residence Permit Provisional Regulations provide that, for those in line with the residence permit conditions, the public security organs shall issue a residence permit within 15 days from the date of application acceptance.
For the time limit of the permit issuance, most of the regions hold the same opinion with the national version, i.e, within 15 days.
Hebei clearly stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents, the residence police station shall issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of acceptance.
Jiangxi stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents, the public security department shall issue a residence permit within 5 working days from the date of acceptance.
In accordance with the "residence permit provisional regulations", the above cities stipulate clearly that the cost of certificate production shall be exempted in case of initial application of the residence permit.
For example, Sichuan required the local police stations or commissioned community service agencies to strictly enforce the approved fee and charge standard and resolutely prohibit over-range or over-standard fees or charge bundling.
It was found that on July 27, 2016, that Chen Yangxia, the former Party secretary of Dingnan County, Ganzhou City, came to the Provincial Commission of Discipline Inspection to take office and served as director of the CPC supervision room (deputy director-general level with a one-year probation period).
The red wine at the dinner of that day was provided by Li Youcai while other costs were borne by another person surnamed Liu.
The Jiangxi Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection announced that Chen Yangxia and Cheng Ziliang, who organized and accepted dining invitations in private clubs, violated the spirit of the central Party committee's eight provisions and the Party's discipline.
Pogba was punished with two yellow cards in last season's Coppa Italia, which automatically results in a one-game ban according to the rules.
Although he has transferred back to the FA Premier League, the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup) still passes his accumulative suspension to the FA Cup.
In this way, on August 14, in the away games of fighting against Bournemouth, Pogba will watch a fight without helping any party. His first show after return to Manchester United will be postponed to the Southampton home game on August 20.
As the No.12 rookie of the first round in 2014, Saric will officially land on the NBA in the next season, and join the Philadelphia 76ers.
As a young European player, Saric is not known to many fans. But I believe he impressed people with his performance in this Olympic Games.
In a game with win by a narrow margin of Croatia over Spain, Saric successfully blocked Pau Gasol's try to drag the game into an overtime inside shot.
Recently, Brett Brown, head coach of the 76ers, gave Saric a high rating. The Spurs head coach thought he saw the spirit of the young Manu Ginobili in Saric.
It is quite clear that Saric already showed his gift and made the 76ers full of expectations on him.
In Croatia's first two games at this year's Olympic Games, Saric achieved a total of 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saric showed his capability of making space in the field. He can have a shot outside the three-point line via the pick and roll with his teammates.
Although the current 76ers is packed with many gifted inside young players, they are not equipped with the outside scoring capability as Saric.
From block shot to a long-pass fast break and achievement of assists, there are just a few insiders who can make it in the NBA field.
Since the beginning of this year's Olympic Games, Saric has obtained 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists in each of the three games, with a perfect performance.
James has signed two 1 + 1 contracts since he decided to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014.
Now, as this labor agreement is about to enter the last year, James will be in the forefront of labor negotiations as the vice chairman of the NBA player union.
The substantial increase in union revenue is attributed to the new television protocol. The question is how the boss and players deal with the money. The outside world is worried that the NBA will come to a standstill in the next summer.
But for James, he will not have to worry about the possibility of becoming a free player next summer because he has renewed a 3-year contract with the Cavaliers.
No matter when the 2017-18 season will officially kick off, James is within the contract.
Since the stunning debut of iPhoneSE, the mobile phone market also ushered in a small screen mobile phone boom.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched the first work of its Z11 series: nubiaZ11mini.
NubiaZ11mini follows the consistent photographed gene, and is equipped with a one-hand easier-to-hold 5.0-inch screen and convenient and easy-to-use back fingerprint recognition, contributing to its superior use experience.
Z11mini, a small screen camera phone which was just listed by Nubia, had a price fall of RMB 200, decreasing from the original RMB 1,499 to RMB 1,299.
In appearance, nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen. The classic "little red circle" design is at the bottom of the obverse side.
The middle frame is made of metal material. Its bottom adopts symmetrical design and is equipped with a Type-C data interface.
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.
The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.
A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.
AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.
It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.
For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.
We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and right across the country, we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they ever will.
At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
According to Zheng Jianjun, the Management Section Chief of Nanhu Park Water Area, the deepest point of the South Lake is more than 10 meters deep. People who do not understand the situation of the water are probably confronted with danger.
"Although the Nanhu Park rescue team is very professional, we still hope that the majority of rowing tourists will wear life jackets and stay away from illegal activities on the lake to play safely." Zheng Jianjun said.
Weitou Village boasts a unique marine environment, with two leisure travel resources including natural ecology and cultural ecology.
"However, several owners who bought the parking lots in the community feared that this would affect the price of their parking space and thought that others may be selfish, so they had been plotting for bad things. This had shelved the parking space transformation. "
As for the question about when the sweet potatoes are introduced and by whom, there are still many different views in the academic community.
According to the current mainstream view, there are three major lines for the introduction of sweet potato.
Among the three lines of introducing sweet potato, the introduction by Chen Zhenlong from Philippine to Fuzhou is the one with the greatest impact and the widest spread.
The Beijing Municipal Social Organization Management Office will soon carry out special inspections on the use of unified receipts for social organization membership fees .
The inspections will be divided into two categories, i.e. unit self-examination and spot inspection.
A responsible person of the municipal social organization office said that the scope of the inspection covers social groups who received unified receipts for social group fees in the office between 2013 and 2015.
"The success of the Olympic Games is defined by people who share stories in social media," said the Rio Olympic Organizing Committee while establishing the Olympic Games communication strategy in 2012.
From the news reports of the Olympic Games, all media have made a lot of big changes in the aspect of mode of transmission, product form, language style, news perspective and many other aspects.
It seems that the International Olympic Committee and the media practitioners around the world will have to meet this round of challenges.
August 11 was the last day for the open sale of Everbright Securities H shares. A source said that there is nothing special in the market response during the first two days of the IPO. According to the plan, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.
A domestic brokerage analyst said that Orient Securities did not enjoy a good foundation in Hong Kong. Only the capital management business is its strength. It has many inherent problems compared with bank-type brokers like Bank of China International and CITIC Securities.
Experts pointed out that with the return of the securities market to flatness, many brokers sagged this year in results. But the situations of securities firms after their listing are dependent on the detailed development performance of their businesses and cannot be generalized.
With the introduction of this new regulation, Suzhou will become the first second-tier city to restart the purchase restriction.
In addition to Suzhou, other second-tier cities including Hefei and Nanjing will also introduce property market regulations and control policies.
Prior to that, Hefei had come the first to issue restrictions on lending policy. For people who have two apartments in Hefei and have one outstanding housing loan, they will be denied by banks in applying for mortgage services.
Last week, the broadcast of period drama “Beauty Private Kitchen” was temporarily halted, and accidentally triggered heated debate about faked ratings of locally produced dramas.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.
They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.
"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.
"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.
After experiencing the “golden era” of a soaring box office in 2015, the film market retreated into a cooling-off period in 2016. Whether box office takings could surpass last year’s total of RMB44.069 billion is questionable.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed that in October, prices of new and second-hand residential properties cooled, up 0.6% and 1.1% month-on-month, respectively.

BBC claims that Beijing has become the most exciting city: making foreigners feel like “living in a new age”
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that the British media organization has noticed that Beijing is rapidly transforming into a glamorous modern city in spite of the fact that it is 3000 years old.
The Chinese capital is interconnected by amazingly high-speed Internet and has implemented cutting-edge technologies such as face recognition. It has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has an unmatched capacity of internationalization. It is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are eager to explore the world.
According to a report on the BBC website on January 16, the German expatriate Clemens Sage said: 'If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere.' He quoted a song written by singer Frank Sinatra to praise New York City.
Sage, who served as Creative Director of Traveler Archives, said: "If Sinatra lives today, he is likely to sing a song for Beijing." He said that living in this city will make you feel like “living in a new age”, which means that you can always keep up with the trends.
Simon Norton, who originates from England had been living in Beijing in recent years, published an article on personal blog site 4Corners7Seas saying: “People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something grand. Although this feeling is hard to describe clearly, it is the reason why so many foreigners stay there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and hope to witness it. ”
According to reports, the city's high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before.
Andy Peñafuerte, who originates from Manila and is currently the deputy editor-in-chief of the website Beijing Children, said: "Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society. The Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smart phones, making it easier for everyone to conduct various transactions."
According to reports, smart phones are just the beginning of Beijing's technical ambitions. Face recognition technology is being widely used across the city. Many mobile phone applications use this technology to facilitate bank transfers and payments, grant people access apartments and offices, and even use it to verify identity of the drivers providing car-hailing service.
Beijing recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial intelligence technology park. When it is completed, more than 400 companies will settle there. They will focus on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food plays a central role in China’s many major traditional festivals. Foreigners are enthusiastic about these festivals. The Spring Festival is the most important festival in both social and economic sense, and it is also one of the most enjoyable festivals for foreigners.
Sage said: “It's a pleasure for me to help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year. It is equally important to clean the apartment and paste the red spring couplets with blessing words on the door. On New Year’s eve, all family members must gather together to have a good meal and stay until midnight, and finally to celebrate the New Year with fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and their family is indeed an opportunity for blending. ”
According to reports, a large number of foreigners are living in Beijing and the number is growing. However, the language barrier and the convenience of exchanges between the expatriates can easily become excuses for not fully integrating into the local culture.
Sage said: 'Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but they have little experience with their host country. If your initial attempt to interact with the Chinese is not successful, then it is easy for you to feel more comfortable with other foreigners.
In these so-called 'foreign bubbles' ('Laowai bubble' refers to circles in which foreigners only mixed in with foreigners, without touching local people and local culture -- translator's note), foreigners mingle with each other in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only make friends with foreigners.
The easiest way to overcome problem is to learn a little bit of Mandarin – something easier than one might think.
Sage said: “One or two hours of private lessons in Chinese every week or learning entry-level radio dramas should suit everyone’s busy schedule.”
Even learning a few classic phrases will help with shopping, ordering a meal in a restaurant, or chatting on a taxi.
According to reports, persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, but the government has tried to curb pollution in recent years.
Residents emphasize that outdoor activities are very important in warm months when pollution is often light. It is important to consider those blue sky days as opportunities for rambling in ancient encryptors or exploring the popular Ritan Park.
Norton said: "Beijing is a Chinese city that one can find most things below the surface. You can find very good arts and music activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient hutong areas."
The report believed that the hindrance to growth in human capital as a result of aging has become increasingly apparent. This was particularly the case in the Northeast, where the annual average contribution of aging to human capital growth was -1.28%.
Pan Gongsheng said that the present of risk of cross-border capital flows can be controlled. The fundamental factors underpinning international balance of payments will still exist over the longer term.
China News Service Beijing December 17 wire (Reporter: Gao Kai) Heritage makes the world resplendent - The opening ceremony of the 2016 International Summit for the Authentication, Restoration and Protection of Ancient Chinese Calligraphy and Painting was held at Renmin University of China on December 17.
In April this year, the European Commission accused Google of coercing mobile phone manufacturers into installing software such as the Google search engine and Chrome web browser, or they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The European Commission believed that this harmed consumer interests and hindered competition.
EU regulators initially requested that Google make a response prior to July 27.
If found guilty of violating antitrust rules, Google could face a maximum fine of 10% of its global turnover, or approximately US$7.4 billion.
Google has not made immediate comment on this.
Google also faced EU investigations over giving prominent placement to its own shopping services in search results.
Zhang Yuning's stay-abroad is a real one. It can be said that his achievement of “jumping level” from the national youth to the national Olympics is by no means accidental, and his leap-forward growth is still surprising.
Understand through a picture: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
Abstract: A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation.
From the visualized maps, the attitude of the eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West. Most countries in the world are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies, indicating that the “risk of the black swan” is still looming large.
*This article is taken from Wallstreetcn (WeChat ID: wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more exciting information, visit wallstreetcn.com or download the Wallstreetcn APP. *
As the authorities in major markets of Bitcoin -- such as China, South Korea and the European Union -- take decisive regulatory measures, the digital currency market dominated by Bitcoin has experienced major bloodshed this week. The price of Bitcoin has fallen below 10,000 dollar, recording the biggest one-day drop.
A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation.
At this important juncture, HowMuch.net, a visualization big data website, produced a map showing the legitimacy of Bitcoin and regulation measure in place in countries around the world.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market for Bitcoin, and orange represents the neutral market. Although there is no place where Bitcoin is acknowledged a legal currency, there are no major restrictions on the use it. The pale pink represents the restricted market, i.e. the local government tries to the use of the digital currency pass by drawing a red line or taking regulatory measures. The deep pink represents countries where Bitcoin is declared as illegal. The gray represents countries that have not yet been rated.
(The above figure was drawn by the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15th)
The article points out that from the distribution of non-green color patches in the graph, it can be seen that the oriental countries in the traditional sense are more conservative towards Bitcoin than the West.
Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal. China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin. India is one of the largest countries that have not commented on Bitcoin and have not made relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions that have highest level of tolerance to Bitcoin i.e. where green patches are concentrated.
The views of the countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly divided, so, the distribution of color patches in these areas is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are all legitimate Bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia have some restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin. Most Latin American countries have not made any comments about Bitcoin.
From the above data, it can be seen that of the 246 countries that have been rated, a total of 99 countries (or 40% of the total) haven't imposed any restrictions on the transactions and use of Bitcoin. They are represented by green and orange patches.
Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) have defined Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53) %) haven't given comments on digital currency (grey).
This shows that countries that account for the global majority (53%, more than half) are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies represented by Bitcoin. This means that the “black swan risk” is still very large for Bitcoin, because some of these countries may ultimately make legislation that restrict the use of digital currencies.
The article believes that global regulators have not fully understood the digital currency as a new type of currency. This may be the main reason why most countries have not chosen a stance.
Although Bitcoin’s popularity has grown exponentially since last year, it does not necessarily mean that all countries are interested in it. It's probably that some countries are concerned that the local currency may be undermined by digital currencies or that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations.
Wallstreetcn has published an article summarizing the news related to regulation measures against Bitcoin across the world since last week, including: China starts to crackdown on online platforms and mobile APPs of over-the-counter exchanges; South Korea is still considering to close the digital currency exchanges; the European Union holds the view that Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “losing everything”.
Wallstreetcn Editor's selection: Reading News | 2018: Global Central Banks Are Ushering Digital Currency? One article points out that 2018 is destined to be the first year of digital currency for central banks across the world, viewing from the perspectives of supervision, acceptance/criticism and adoption.
The act of questioning the legal status of Bitcoin by big countries such as Russia is actually meant to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies.
On January 8th, the Barcelona new aid Philippe Coutinho showed up for the first time in Camp Nou with his Barcelona shirt, the Xinhua News Agency reported in Madrid by reporter Xie Yuzhi.
Coutinho passed a physical examination of Barcelona early that morning and signed with Barcelona president Bartomeu a contract that will expire in the summer of 2023.
Then he appeared in the face of nearly 7,000 Camp Nou fans as a Barcelona player.
According to a Spanish media, Coutinho's transfer fee may amount to 160 million euros (1 euro≈ 1.77 Chinese yuan), being the highest paid player in the history of Barcelona and La Liga.
As Coutinho is still injured at the moment, he still need recuperate for nearly 20 days before ushering in his debut in the Barcelona shirt.
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.
As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.
Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.

World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.
"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.
And the guy on the corner street, too.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
"Eilidh is slightly modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.
Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.
As for my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.
So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."

Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
He chafed at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
But it matters.
And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.
He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Any movement in the property market would have an impact on the sensibilities of the general public.
Purchase quota is a fixed threshold many cities would adopt when implementing real estate control measures.
In May 2017, Jinan issued regulations stating that undergraduates who make social security contributions consecutively for half a year will be entitled to be treated under the same residential property purchase policies as that of local residents with permanent residency.
In June, Wuhan issued policies that stipulate that university students may settle in the city within three years of graduation based on their graduation certificate and employment permit.
After the policy was enhanced, officials stated that “university students are entitled to purchase residential property at a 20% discount to market price”.
In July, Chengdu issue regulations stating that young talent with overseas university bachelor’s degree or higher academic qualifications may apply to settle in Chengdu based on their graduation certificate.
In addition, Kunshan, Lingang in Shanghai, as well as other cities or regions also issued relevant “talent introduction” policies, and lowered the threshold for buying residential property and settling locally for talents.
Zhang Hongwei believed that this was, in fact, large cities competing for population, particularly talent. Only by retaining population, particularly talent, can a city be competitive. This then, was the key significance of these real estate policies.
Some even believed that this implied that the time has come to abolish residential property “purchase quotas”.
Director Derek Yee said that day that he had plans to film for a long time. The first time the screenplay was adapted was in 1999. He was even prepared to get Takeshi Kaneshiro to play the role of Yan Shisan.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.
Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.
He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf in.
The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."
Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.
I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Zou Shoumin, Director of the Bureau of Environmental Supervision of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, said on the 22nd in Beijing that on a nationwide basis, 57 cases were subject to consecutive daily fines. The newly amended “Environmental Protection Law”, implemented at the beginning of this year, has significantly enhanced environmental law enforcement efforts in China.
Presently, the environmental protection bureaus across China may use various means of punishment to investigate and deal with conduct in violation of environmental regulations such as impose consecutive daily fines, close down operations and/or distrain, limit or suspend production, and persons held under administrative detention. They will also work together with judicial organs to punish environmental crimes.
Zou Shoumin said that in August, a total of 335 cases were concerned with closing close down operations and/or distrain; 177 cases pertained to limiting or suspension of production; 189 cases were concerned with persons held under administrative detention; and 166 cases pertained to persons held under suspicion of environmental pollution crimes.
In particular, Henan imposed consecutive daily fines on seven cases. At present, China is moving from control at the end toward being involved throughout the entire process, intensifying efforts to treat environmental pollution on an all-round basis.
Although pressures from slower economic growth have emerged, China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection had already made its position clear; China should correctly and appropriately position environmental protection in economic growth, and increase “green determination”. The more economic growth decelerates, the more it should hold fast to environmental protection, and ensure that environmental protection plays a positive role in optimizing the economy.

The report of the 19th National Congress of the CPC pointed out that to deepen the reform of the science and technology system and establish an innovation system that takes the enterprise as the main body, the market as the orientation and the industry-university-research institute must have deep integration,
which is precisely for the reform mechanism to promote innovation and create a better atmosphere for the innovation subject.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.
An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.
There is no public transport.
The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to compete.
"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.
The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.
As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.
The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never reappear.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds the discontent.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.
What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically backed the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.
"What else could we do?"
Brands such as Suofeiya, Holike and Topstrong have leveraged the strength of capital to actively grow their business in the customized home furnishing industry. On February 10, 2017, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the IPO application of Guangzhou Shangpin Home Collection Co., Ltd., and issued a listing permit on the Small and Medium Enterprise Board of Shenzhen Stock Exchange. More than 20 days ago, Oppein Home Group received approval for its IPO.
Industry insiders believed that with the listings of Shangpin Home Collection and Oppein Home Group, the customized home furnishing sector, which was already soaring, will turn from production competition to competing for capital.
At the beginning of the new year, when Shangpin Home Collection’s IPO was first approved, news of the listing of this classic brand, which represented the customized home furnishing sector, attracted the attention of the entire home furnishing industry.
On the 9th (Beijing time), Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd launched its first set of components for autonomous driving and infotainment solutions it jointly developed with Harman International on Tuesday. This was a major move by the company to expand into the automotive electronics market.
Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International about a year ago.
At the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held in Las Vegas this week, Samsung unveiled its automotive camera equipped with collision warning, lane-departure warning, and adaptive cruise control, which was also developed jointly with Harman.
Samsung plans to begin shipping this camera system, which is built on automatic machine learning and augmented reality technology this year.
Samsung also exhibited a “digital cockpit”, which allows a car to adapt to the personalized characteristics of the driver even if he or she is not the car owner by accessing the user’s information from mobile devices and cloud.

Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.
It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.
The Williams team also suggested that Massa might return, even though he had already announced his retirement.
January 9 is just a month away from the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. As the Olympic torch relay moves north, warm-ups and intense preparations for the Games were carried out. South Korea was warming up for the Winter Olympics.
Public opinion in South Korea hope that this long-waited North-South Dialog would lead to an “Easter egg” (nice surprise) for the countdown to the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.
The Winter Olympic torch arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year.
The fervor stirred up by the Olympic torch is directly reflected on the sale of admission tickets for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.
A little over two months ago, the proportion of tickets sold lingered at 32% for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, and a mere 4.3% for the Winter Paralympics. The sluggish ticket sales caused concern among the outside world about the popularity of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics at one point.
However, just as the Chairman of the PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games, Lee Hee-Beom predicted, “As the Winter Olympic torch is carried and passed on across South Korea, interest in the Winter Olympics will rise. I believe that ticket sales will turn around very quickly”.
South Korean media reported that as of January 3, the proportion of tickets sold for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics has reached 64%, and that for the Paralympics has also exceeded 50%.
To encourage foreigners to come to watch the Games, South Korea’s Ministry of Justice has also announced on the 8th that foreigners who visit the country for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics may extend their stay for up to 120 days.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.
The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.
As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.
At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."
In addition to the external factor of rebounding steel prices, enterprises are also forging arduously ahead on the path of lowering costs.

Since the second half of 2009, sales (volume) of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs have remained relatively buoyant. This Spring in particular, sales of Xiaoshan’s seedlings recorded a historic high. Sales volume grew significantly and prices jumped. Statistics revealed that for the first six months of the year, the sales revenue of seedlings in the Xiaoshan District increased by 48% year-on-year, and the magnitude of the growth rate was the biggest in nearly 20 years.
Shi Haiyong, Deputy Director of the Xiaoshan Forestry Bureau, said that the production of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs also grown rapidly along with the positive sales trend.
In the last two years, the planting acreage of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs have expanded by 30,000 mu, with total area at 180,000 mu. At the same time, expansion is being actively carried out outside the region. Xiaoshan’s farmers have been setting up flowering tree and shrub bases totaling 80,000 mu across the country, an increase of 30,000 mu from that in 2008.
While expanding planting acreage, the quality of the seedlings have also continued to improve; the existing value of the nurseries has been rising. More large specimen and high quality seedlings have been preserved, and sellers have been reluctant to sell some seedlings.
Shi Haiyong also said that confronted with the current buoyant peak production and sales period, producers should calmly face and objectively analyze the situation, and take into consideration that the demand for flowering trees and shrubs is long term and will continue to increase. At the same time, they should also be aware that market competition will intensify.
July 13 morning Beijing Time. US-based Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas accusing Apple of infringing on a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.
The company had previously used the same patent to sue Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.
The lawsuit claimed that iPhone 6s and Apple equipment similar to it have violated US Patent No. 7,657,386, which is known as “Integrated battery service system”.
The plaintiff is seeking monetary damages or royalties on the infringing equipment upon announcement of the verdict.
According to the indictment, the plaintiff appears to believe that iPhone’s fast-charging technology jas violated the former’s patent.
iPhone’s fast-charging function charges the battery quickly until to 80% of its capacity, then switches to slower trickle charging.
Somaltus is actually a so-called “patent troll” because the company does not provide any apparent product or service, and it is hard to find any information on the company online.
However, it has successfully reached out-of-court settlement with auto makers such as Ford and Nissan with this patent.
The meeting believed that accelerating information development; promoting interconnection and integration, as well as efficient utilization of resources; and enhancing the level of digitization and intelligence in industry would have great significance for advancing “Made in China 2025”; entrepreneurship and innovation by the masses; developing new drivers; and raising the standard of living for the masses.

Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."

Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.
"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
But not one was ever prosecuted.
Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.
Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.
Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks put it more succinctly.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.
Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.
"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said n---a, get off my property!"
Rascona fires back.
There's a beat.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
He's alarmed, confused.
Did I go too hard?
"No," Greene said through chuckles.
"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"
"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.
"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"
And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.
Absolutely no one laughs.
The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks on every other word.
A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.
They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.
As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.
Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.
"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.
He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.
"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.
"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.
Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
As regards implementing market-oriented reforms associated with natural gas, the importance of reform with respect to “pipeline and grid independence” is self-evident, but more resistance and controversy can be expected.
On the 7th, reporters learned from Kailuan (Group) that at 11:25 am on the 7th, an explosion occurred at the emulsifying workshop of Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co., Ltd. which is located at Guye District of Tangshan, Hebei Province; 13 operators were trapped at the site of the explosion.
To date, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued, and rushed to the hospital for immediate medical treatment, while emergency rescue operations are still ongoing for the other 12.
It is understood that the scene of the explosion has been sealed. The local public security, firefighting, medical and other departments are carrying out rescue operations at the scene at this time.
Eye witnesses said that there was a loud bang when the explosion occurred, and a mushroom cloud rose instantly.
According to the staff of Kailuan (Group) who were organizing the rescue effort at the scene, Tangshan Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co., Ltd., located at Northern Zhaoge Village, Guye District, Tangshan, Hebei Province, is a State approved designated enterprise that produces explosives for civilian use.

US media: Scientists from the Air Force Engineering University of China looking into laser satellite to clean up space debris
Reference News January 18 report US media claims that Chinese scientists have put forward a daring and innovation proposal - to use large lasers to clean up the messy Earth orbit, and destroy old satellites as well as other space debris.
A January 15 report on US “Newsweek” website stated that researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China have written a thesis on “Research on de-orbiting model of small scale space debris removal using space-based laser”. This thesis described how by using space-based platform lasers, space debris would be rendered smaller and less dangerous as a result of laser radiation.
The report claimed that for years, space debris has always been a matter of concern for international space agencies. NASA has considered many alternative plans to track, probe and remove human made debris.
The methods for cleaning up large space debris include using an enormous net to clean up and collect the debris, as well as using magnetic material to suck them out of the orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted a laser simulation study and arrived at the following conclusion. This will be an effective method for cleaning up the Earth’s orbit.
The abstract of the thesis claimed that “(the simulated study) has provided the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal by using space-based laser.”
A 2014 research conducted by US defense industry giant Lockheed Martin revealed that as far as orbiting satellites are concerned, approximately 200 deterrents exist daily.
The high-speed debris of orbiting satellites are regarded as serious threats to future space missions, and have been described by European Space Agency experts as a “series of fatal threats”. High-speed debris has continued to rise annually over the years.
According to a January 17 report on the US-based “Popular Mechanics” website, space is basically empty, but space around Earth has become increasingly crowded. Every satellite we send into space will ultimately become debris orbiting Earth. As time passes, these debris will accumulate.
As debris increase, the probability of a satellite that is still operating normally being hit by debris becomes higher, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of US dollars.
The report claimed that all space agencies have formulated plans to remove space debris in the future.
NASA is considering firing atmospheric gases to reduce the speed of the debris so that it would de-orbit. Europe is looking at launching a satellite with a large net to capture the debris and it back to earth. Japan’s idea is to use a power chain to capture the debris.
At this time, China has also put forward a method of solving the space debris problem, and that is, to use a large laser to shrink the floating space debris into smaller, less harmful pieces.
According to a thesis published in German magazine “Optics”, a group of researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China claimed that installing such a laser on a satellite would be enough to effectively clean up space; at least, according to the simulated results, that is.
The report claimed that the only way to prove effectiveness is to carry out tests. Currently, there are no arrangements for such as mission, but sooner or later, someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space.
Once this is achieved, we can finally bid farewell to space debris problems for good.

Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.
The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds.
A few days ago, the China Athletic Association issued a serious notice to severely beat the phenomenon of running for others, and prepared to punish violators with a lifelong ban.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."
The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.
But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Best of luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.
"We're the main names.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ... ."
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.
They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.
"This is the fight to be made.
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.
Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."

The position stated by National Development and Reform Commission officials as regards achieving the emission reduction target of the 11th Five-Year Plan ahead of time gives the steel industry, which has been subjected to power supply and production quotas, strong expectations of resumption of production.
Although steel plants, as of now, have yet to receive clear notification from local governments announcing that work related to energy conservation and emission reduction has ended, the industry expects that by around December 15, 2010, steel plants nationwide that have been subjected to production quotas will resume production successively. Steel prices could start to come under pressure.
A spokesperson from a private steel enterprise in Hebei told our reporter that notice to end power supply and production quotas has yet to be received at this time, but in reality, pressure on all enterprises have eased significantly when compared to that in September and October.
Some local governments in Hebei Province have repeatedly issued documents related to power supply and production quotas, and have adopted mandatory power shutdown measures to limit production.
The reporter learned from local enterprises that the steel plants of most regions in Hebei have resumed production at this time, and pressure from production quotas have eased.
Mysteel.com analyst Zhang Tieshan estimated that end-user demand for construction steel will gradually weaken as winter has already arrived in Northern China.
Coupled with the energy conservation and emission reduction program winds down, most steel plants will generally resume production by around December 15. Products will gradually make their way to markets across the country before New Year’s Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will exert some pressure on soaring steel prices.

To date, “Game of Thrones” has already received 38 Emmy Awards, becoming the TV series that has won the most Emmy Awards in history.
Regrettably, none of the actors in “Game of Thrones” won an award.
A few years ago, people who were allowed to set foot in the venture capital sector were limited to those who had founded companies and subsequently joined venture capital companies, or analysts who worked in venture capital companies who hoped to further their careers.
Entrepreneurs would be able to more easily raise funds from the numerous investors on the AngelList, and would therefore not have to rely on on agents to put them in contact with top venture capital companies.
CRI Online (Liu Pai): The Economic & Commercial Section of the Embassy of the Republic of Italy in China held a Sino-Italian Cooperation Program for Environmental Protection on the 18th. Participants from corporations and scientific research institutions of the two countries had an extensive exchange of views in respect of cooperation between the two countries as regards renewable resources under a new state of affairs, and reached a consensus.
It is understood that the participating Chinese representatives mainly comprised those from China Recycling Development Corporation Ltd and International Technology Transfer Network, while the Italian representatives included those from the Global Energy Environmental Exchange Organization, federation of businesses of the greater Bologna region, and other entities.
The Italian representatives said that Italy has a myriad of environmental protection technologies and solutions in the renewable resources sector, and proposed to carry out pilot programs with the Chinese in three areas, namely, industrial waste treatment, waste oil treatment, and waste incineration and disposal. It also looked forward to promoting its environmental protection partnership experience with China in other regions around the world.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.
They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."
When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."
West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."
Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Fang Wenshan said frankly that using music to tell an entire story is his dream.
A song lasts between four and five minutes, so telling an entire story would be very difficult.
When I write songs, I am assailed by emotion. There is no story line. I’ve always felt that that was a real pity.
Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.
At the promotional event for the first anniversary of the implementation of the “Regulations of Beijing Municipality on Smoking Control” held this morning, young student representatives of the video clip, “My Smoking Control Declaration”, which won the national youth smoking control video clip award, interacted with national smoking control ambassador Huang Xuan, and reviewed the video of the activities concerned with calling for entries for the contest, as well as the screening of the excellent award winning works.
Reporters from The Mirror learned from the event that young actor Huang Xuan was engaged to become the national smoking control ambassador.
Huang Xuan said he used to smoke when he was in university. After having fully understood the dangers of smoke, he stopped smoking successfully. This time, he proactively assumed the duty of a quit-smoking ambassador, calling on youths to stay away from tobacco.
Audiences put on masks, and exist like a spirit in the story. This is most critical rule of the game in “Sleep No More”.
The RMB middle price is registered at 6.4401, a depreciation of 66 basis points. The rising slows down.

Tencent Financial News on January 18, the USD-to-RMB middle prices is registered at 6.4401, a depreciation of 66 basis points compared with the last trading day, ending the rise spanning five consecutive days.
In the overnight market, the US dollar experienced a V-shaped rebounded, ending at 90.8900 as of 07:30, Beijing time.
The Beige Book published by Federal Reserve shows that almost all 12 Fed regions reported mild to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018. The Federal Reserve remains optimistic about the outlook for this year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. unemployment rate remained at 4.1% in December, the lowest since 2000, and companies are expected to increase wages in the coming months.
Fed officials generally believe that tax reform is a factor supporting this modest strengthening of the economic outlook. The Fed predicts that the economy will increase by 2.5% in 2018 and the interest rate will be raised three times.
Some market observers have point out that the expected tightening of ECB’s monetary policy pushes up the exchange rate of the Euro in recent days. As a result, the US dollar index declines continuously, and the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar has seen a surge in prices. However, the European Central Bank is unlikely to adjust the policy stance soon. After the short-term fluctuation of the foreign exchange market, the exchange rates will eventually return to a level dictated by the fundamentals, and the continued smooth operation of the RMB exchange rate is a high probability event.
It is worth noting that, as the market expects a more stable renminbi, the attractiveness of renminbi assets to foreign investors will also gradually increase.
The People’s Bank of China has authorized the China Foreign Exchange Trade System to release the interbank foreign exchange market central parity rates of the RMB: USD1 to RMB6.4401, EUR1 to RMB7.8482, JPY100 to RMB5.7854, HKD1 to RMB0.82399, GBP1 to RMB8.9017, AUD1 to RMB5.1302, NZD1 to RMB4.6779, SGD 1 to RMB4.8546, CHF1 to RMB6.6731, CAD1 to RMB5.1747, RMB1 to MYR 0.61399, RMB1 to RUB8.8352, RMB1 to ZAR1.9128, RMB1 to KRW165.95, RMB1 to AED0.57030, RMB1 to SAR0.58233, RMB1 to HUF39.3106, RMB1 to PLN0.53093, RMB1 to DKK0.9487, RMB1 to SEK1.2501, RMB1 to NOK1.2240, RMB1 to TRY0.59303, RMB1 to MXN2.9071.
At 7.50 am today (March 10), a chemical plant in Xinxiang County, Henan Province, exploded, with black smoke billowing at the scene.
The Beijing News reporter learned from the Xinxiang County Party Committee Propaganda Department that one person was injured in the explosion.

This afternoon, Xinxiang County Party Committee Propaganda Department responded to the incident. The explosion occurred at 7.50am. The fire is now effectively under control. One person was slightly injured. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.
A Beijing News reporter noticed that in 2015, the chemical plant in question was exposed by the media including Henan TV Station for contamination in violation of the law.
That day, 85-year-old Yoji Yamada, the original director of “What a Wonderful Family!” flew to Beijing to visit the set personally.

Established in 2000, the China Environmental Award is the most prestigious award in the field of environmental protection in China. The judging panel is made up of many Central government departments.
Li Wei, head of the judging panel and Secretary-General of China Environmental Protection Foundation said that China is now confronted with legacy ecological issues from a growth model that was GDP-heavy and environmental protection-light for a few decades.
The selection of the current China Environmental Award was aimed at honoring entities and individuals that have contributed to improving the environment and people’s livelihoods so as to reflect popular will.
As far as the judging panel was concerned, Tonglu County in Zhejiang Province which was founded on the basis of ecology should win this honor.

How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.
Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."
Smart interactive robot developer Rokid received new investment; Temasek is the lead investor
In recent years, start-ups in the AI sector have continued to be a hot favorite of capital.
AI Rokid recently completed a round of funding, led by Temasek. Other investors included Credit Suisse, CDIB (the investment arm of China Development Financial Holdings Co., Ltd.), and existing shareholder IDG Capital.
It is understood that the size of this round of funding was approximately US$100 million. Both Credit Suisse and CDIB were first time investors in China’s domestic AI industry.
Rokid is a developer of smart interactive robots, and is committed to robotics research. It products can control smart devices in the home, and has continuous autonomous learning and growth functions. It also features recognition, comprehension and feedback functions.
Proceeds from this round of funding will be used for R&D, talent recruitment, strategic push and industry chain investment layout.
Rokid previously raised US$8.3 million in August 2014 in the Angel Round from IDG, Linear Venture, Mfund and Vision Capital. In October 2014, the company again received at least US$10 million in Series A funding led by Walden International, with the Angel investors as participants. On November 1, 2016, Rokid completed Series B funding, led by Advantech Capital; other investors included IDG, Mfund, Vision Capital and Walden International.
At the time, Rokid claimed that after the Series B funding, the company’s valuation would reach US$450 million.
In May 2017, Rokid unveiled its consumer class smart voice robot “Rokid - Pebble”, integrating AI and the home, priced at RMB1,399.
This robot uses speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition technology and microphone array technology, with conversational, music broadcast and smart home features.
It has won two major CES awards - Tech For A Better World and Home Audio/Video Components And Accessories, as well as Germany’s iF Design Award, known as the Oscars of the design world.
At the 2018 CES which had just ended, Rokid unveiled another new product: the consumer class augmented reality AR glasses RokidGlass.
These glasses are used as independent head displays, and do not require connections to smartphones or external computers. It is expected to be commercialized in 2018.
Previously, the company had already released its first generation home robot, RokidAlien and second generation product, smart voice box RokidPebble.

“Tofu”, a 3D animated feature film designed for a general audience held its premiere in Wuhan on the 25th. Zou Yi, Director of “Tofu”, Meng Zhihui, Animation Director of “Tofu”, as well as Tom Disher, film soundtrack composer and Emmy Award winner were present to share their behind-the-scenes story of the film’s creation.
“Tofu” is based on a traditional allusion concerning Liu An, Prince of Huainan in the Han Dynasty - “Liu An made a mistake and invented tofu”. It is an account of “Dou Fu”, the leading character, a bean who miraculously took on human form, how he overcame numerous difficulties and persevered in his dream to become an immortal. This adorable animated film about becoming an immortal is closely connected with Hubei’s local culture.
Wudang Mountains, located in Shiyan, Hubei Province, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as the place of origin of Toaist culture and Wudang martial arts. It is known as “a unique scenic spot since ancient times, and the premier celestial mountain in the world”.
Director Zou Yi revealed that he and his creative team traveled to Wudang Mountains to conduct research for the film prior to its creation.
He said that the story of “Tofu” occurred during the reign of Emperor Wu of Western Han Dynasty, against the backdrop of Liu An, Prince of Huainan, making pills to attain immortality. The leading character “Dou Fu” was a bean that miraculously took on human form by accident while Liu An was making these pills.
In addition to Wudang Mountains, the place of origin of Toaist culture, Hubei Province is also closely connected with the chime - a traditional musical instrument with long history in China.

Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.
But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.
It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.
It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).
And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.
The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.
Reporters learned from recent interviews that the performance of the steel, rail transport, shipping vessel, machinery manufacture and other industries has fallen in general; some have even incurred losses.
Some experts believed that under the present circumstances, a new round of revitalization of the industries in Northeast China will not only concern the nation’s current economic recovery, it will also have an impact on the long-term growth and international competitiveness of China's manufacturing sector. Hence, there is an urgent call for adjustments and structural transformation to take place.
Traditional industries saw a general decline in performance, and even incurred losses. The raw material industry, and the heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing sector saw performance decline significantly, and even incurred losses. These were the first signs from the industries in Northeast China amid the current sluggish economy.
When the economy decelerated in the past, low-end and primary commodities were the most significantly affected. In the current economic fluctuation however, both high- and low-end industrial products of Northeast China’s traditional industries were affected.
A few years ago, Ansteel Group (Weibo) began by adjusting its product mix, and gave priority to developing high-end steel plates such as those for containers, railroad tracks, shipbuilding, and civilian home appliances. However, sales of these product categories fell significantly. In particular, the sales volume of steel plates for shipbuilding plunged 50% year-on-year.
Angang Steel Company (Hao Qingshun, Director of the Metallurgical Department of Liaoning Provincial Industry and Informatization Commission, said that metallurgy was the third largest pillar industry in Liaoning, with annual steel production capacity of 60 million tonnes, ranked third nationwide.
For the first five months of this year, crude steel production in Liaoning Province amounted to 21.54 million tonnes. Sales of products required by projects that were encouraged by national policy and where there was strong local government construction activity was better. Products in which market competition was more intense fell by a larger magnitude. This was another characteristic of Northeast China’s manufacturing sector.

Yang Yang, who underwent surgery on his right ear just a few days ago, made an appearance for the first time after his recuperation. He interpreted his character as someone who “does not wear his heart on his sleeve”, quietly giving his all to Bai Qian, and concealing all his feelings.
Yang Yang said that he had to rouse all his emotions to convey the character’s hidden sadness to the audience. “This was certainly a new challenge for me as an actor. While acting this character, I was so emotionally suppressed that I almost suffered internal injury”.
Liu Yifei, meanwhile, revealed that while acting her character in the movie, she cried so much that she collapsed at one point.
The Japanese Olympic Committee recently said that the Japanese delegation was targeted at 30 gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and making Japan into the Top Three.
In October last year, Chairman Yamashita Tasuhiro of the Athletes Commission of Japanese Olympic Committee expressed his expectation that the Japanese athletes can win 2.5 times more gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics than at the Rio Olympics.
At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Japanese delegation ranked 6th in the Gold List with 12 gold medals.
The representatives formed their own groupings, and walked to the venue holding umbrellas.
Traffic on the roads surrounding the venue remained normal. There were no balloons or slogans at the venue, nor a red carpet; displays of plants and fresh flowers were absent as well.
Yesterday, the second session of the fourth People’s Congress of Guang’an City convened without much ado.
On entering GuangAn International Convention and Exhibition Center, slogans were absent from the venue, and there were no tea cups; not even a bottle of mineral water was present.
Instead, there a simple banner, a meeting place, a simple recyclable paper document bag containing materials for the meeting and a recyclable paper cup for tea or water.
The meeting materials were less dense than that of the past. A few pieces of paper summarized the theme and the agenda of the meeting.
“Be thrifty for the people. Those whose duty are to be frugal must live frugally. A return to the current simple and down-to-earth meeting environment, we fully comprehend and welcome it.” GuangAn People’s Congress deputy Wang Cheng said that an efficient and practical meeting without formalism is what they want to see and in which they want to participate.
Experts pointed out that both inflationary and deflationary pressures have eased at this time. This was undoubtedly good news for the financial and economic structural transformation stage.

Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.
It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.
In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.
Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.
The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."

NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.
Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.
Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.
The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'

Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.
"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.
The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.
Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.
These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."
It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.

The Ministry of Land and Resources as well as other relevant departments must take the initiative to serve, consider the overall situation associated with the structural transformation and integrated reform experimental zone program, and actively strive for policy support from the State.
July 26 news: On July 22, reporters learned from Hongqiao District that the upgrading project of the city’s largest downtown riverside linear park has been completed, and the park will be opened to the public free of charge.
The entire landscaped zone leveraged the existing natural ecology as well as the strengths of historical and cultural resources, and re-planning as well as upgrading and transformation was carried out on both banks of the South Grand Canal. Five riverside scenic spots along the river were created, namely, “Emperor Yongle’s Ferry Crossing Heritage Park”, “Wellington Plaza”, “Xintiandi Folk Street”, “Tianjin West Railway Station Gallery” and “Shuixi Artistic Heritage Green Corridor”.
Plastic paved pathways of approximately 1,500 meters with distance markers have been built in the green open space on both sides of the river bank between Jinhua Bridge and Xinsantiao Stone Bridge.
In addition to the flowers, plants and trees planted on both sides of the pathway, a children’s playground has been constructed, embellished with various groups of small sculptures.
As you walk along, you will see benches, paved pathways, bridges, riverside decks, sand pits for children to play in, and other amenities. These help integrate the green landscape and water sights into one, offering residents another place for leisure, fitness and entertainment.
Yesterday, a list of 23 players to participate in the China Cup was released by Chinese national coach Lippi, and caused great controversy in the society.
How to deal with China’s renewable energy vehicle “subsidy fraud” has become a matter of serious concern for the public and even the international automobile industry community after the case was exposed in January this year.

Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.
Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.
A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.
Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.
"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.
"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."
On Friday, that hope appeared gone.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

It is impossible to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation simply by doing some easy works and having celebrations.
Military struggle is an important aspect in fighting great battles, and the ability to win battles serves as a strategic ability required for safeguarding national security.
The whole military should strength awareness of hardship, awareness of crisis and awareness of war fighting, concentrate on fighting war and make every effort to prepare for war.
Improve the ability in war preparation and war fighting as soon as possible
Efforts should be made to fight innovative war and make preparation for war, keep up with evolution in war situation and method of war fighting,
align with war tasks and opponents and arouse a trend of researching on war-related issues
Efforts should be made to improve construction of the commanding system and ability in joint operation, emancipate mind, make innovations in practice and work harder, build a strong and high-efficiency...
Efforts should be made to deepen actual war-based military training and insist on the principle that military training should be performed completely based on requirements of actual war.
Enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of officers and soldiers should be given full play,
and an upsurge of military training should be aroused in the whole army

Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.
Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.
Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.
This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How'd that work out?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.
Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.

It is reported that during the three-day New Year's holiday, more than 65,000 tourists visit Anchang Ancient Town.
In Zhejiang, a town with a unique style such as Anchang Ancient Town is scattered all over like stars. The glittering waves of Jiaxing Xitang is flowing with the warmth and gratefulness of the lower reaches of the Yangze River in the south; the white walls of Quzhou's Nianbadu Ancient Town convey to us the changes over time in the town; and the murals of fishermen in Shitang, Taizhou draw a picture of their life, both traditional and modern. These towns are the "palm treasure" of Zhejiang tourism and also the favorites of tourists from all regions.
In recent years, with the promotion of tourism construction throughout the whole region, the potential of Zhejiang’s small towns have been gradually awakened.
In 2016, the provincial government office issued the "The implementation of the creation of a tourist town in Zhejiang Province”, which proposed that the province would accept and name about 100 tourist towns with strong folk customs, beautiful ecological environment and rich tourism industries after 5 years or so.
Today, these little towns have become key destinations for visitors to Zhejiang who come to admire the natural scenery, savor Zhejiang culture, and feel nostalgic about Zhejiang. They will also become key drivers to help the Province create “Picturesque Zhejiang”, China’s most beautiful tourist destination.
The responsible people of the Provincial Tourism Bureau established that with the rise of these tourism style towns, we must now pay more attention to the construction of the personalized tourism industry and new tourism projects and formats emerging one after another. These have brought rich experiences to tourists and earned glowing reputations.
Emphasis on promotion
Recently, directed by the Zhejiang Provincial Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily Press Group, the Tourism Full Media Center of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group hosted the “Towns × Future artists" sharing session and the 2017 promotion season of Zhejiang style tourism towns, "Poetic Zhejiang, Towns with folk customs”. The closing ceremony took place in the Zhejiang exhibition hall.
“A style town has artistic beauty and living warmth.
The style of the towns lies in the original sense, flavor and township, which represents the original purity.
Xie Hanfeng, a teacher at the School of Film and Television Animation Arts of China’s Academy of Art, the domestic A-list film and television advertising director, and Professor Xu Xianghong, the dean of the School of Art and Communication at China Jiliang University, talked about the cross-border stories of towns through Towns in the lens and Reconstruction of small village.
Many scenic tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources. Dong Xinjian, a town deputy from Nanxun, Huzhou, appeared in the site in person and interpreted Nanxun as a traditional Chinese painting.
The style of towns in the south of the lower reaches of the Yangze River have been popular with painters since ancient times. Nowadays, the Nanxun Ancient Town is developing in-depth cooperation with art academies such as the China Academy of Art.
Tourism style towns must be equipped with elements of style, tourism, service and the environment.
Among these, tourism service facilities and the environment are very important.
If the tourists are handed in an umbrella on a rainy day, they can better experience the town’s style.
In the era of sharing, the Tourism Full Media Center of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group teamed up with the hottest shared umbrella company to customize a number of shared umbrellas in “Poetic Zhejiang” style, hoping to promote the concept of “Sharing and Green”, spread the awareness of civilized tourism and public morality among tourists and residents, and create a shared, beautiful tourist environment.
This has become a bright spot in the 2017 promotional season of Zhejiang’s tourism towns, "Poetic Zhejiang, Towns with folk customs”.
Expecting wonders
Up to now, Zhejiang Province has released the list of the first 21 provincial-level tourism towns that will ultimately culminate in a grand total of 115 provincial tourism towns.
As the prior area for the development of rural tourism during the “13th Five-Year Plan” period, the style towns will eventually be built into tourist attractions with a grade of 3A or higher, becoming a new model for tourism product diversity, tourism benefits and industrial integration.
What makes tourism style towns attractive is their authenticity and originality.
The beauty of the tourism style towns not only stems from the misty bridges and rivers, but also from a long history of cultural tradition; the revitalization of the country is due to cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the world, the tulips of the Netherlands’ Lisse Town, the salt of Austria’s Hallstatt Town, and the pumpkins of Pumpkin Town in France, have been attracting a large number of tourists from all over the world each year. This has allowed the realization that tourism could help the economic growth of smalls towns as well.
For the style towns, the point “Emphasis on characteristics and retention of nostalgia” has given the towns a distinct personality and soul, further providing cultural permeation, carrying local cultural traditions, and highlighting native civilizations.
Tourism style towns, with culture and nostalgia as the link and humanities and scenery as the carrier, connect tourists all over the world while inherit and innovate the traditional customs and cultures in the co-construction and sharing process.
Essentially speaking, the tourism style town is a complex open-style tourism area, and it should be a shared living space for local residents, exotic tourists and even sojourners.
As the main battlefield for tourism growth in the future, tourism style towns will change the rural ecological landscape, economic and social development patterns, and the flow direction of industrial factors. Additionally, they will play an important role in eliminating the urban-rural infrastructure gap, hastening rural cultural recovery.
In the wake of accelerating revitalization of the countryside, Zhejiang tourist towns will receive a more abundant and wonderful story.

Travellers negotiate trench, return to 'Millionaire's row'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.
Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.
Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.
The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.'
She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'
One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'
The Fifth Session of the 12th National People's Congress held its closing ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 15.
This is an interview with Ma Junsheng, Director-General of the State Post Bureau.
Xinhua News Agency/Chen Yehua/CRI Online: The Fifth Session of the 12th National People's Congress held its closing ceremony at the Great Hall of the People at 9am on March 15.
Prior to the closing ceremony, Ma Junsheng, Director-General of the State Post Bureau, expressed during an interview at the “ministers’ passage” that the State will strengthen supervision over prominent issues that currently exist in the express delivery industry such as late delivery and loss of or damaged parcels, and guide and enhance self-discipline in the industry.
Ma Junsheng said that efforts to resolve four major prominent issues in the express delivery industry will be enhanced this year. The development of the express delivery industry in China has entered the express lane.
In 2012, express delivery volume in China stood at 5.6 billion items, and at least 10,000 express delivery three-wheelers were deployed. A single standard, a unique logo and a unified insurance were implemented, which facilitated delivery and ensured safety.

Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Lian Ping, Chief Economist of the Bank of Communications, said that as value added of industry for each of the first three quarters of 2017 was stronger toward the end of the quarter, the growth rate of value added of industry in December could accelerate to 6.6%.
Cumulative growth rate of fixed asset investment in December is forecast to be at 7.2%, unchanged from the previous month, but lower than that a year ago.
Industrial production, while weaker than that in October, will remain generally unchanged from that in November.
Investment in China’s manufacturing sector was low in December, but infrastructure investment improved slightly. As such, fixed asset investment for the month will remain the same as that in November.

Beijing’s new measure to “shift and relocate institutions of higher learning”: 10,000 BUCT teachers and students move into new campus at Changping
The opening ceremony of Beijing University of Chemical Technology’s (BUCT) new campus was held at the Changping District of Beijing on the 2nd, and school officially commenced at the 1,800 mu green campus.
Reporters learned from the ceremony that for the purposes of enhancing the capital’s core functions, and treating “large urban center diseases”, on the back of cooperative development among Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province as well as the shifting and relocation of non-capital related functions, Beijing has accelerated the program to shift and relocate institutions of higher learning situated in central districts to suburban districts in recent years. The teachers and students of some institutions of higher learning are relocating in batches to new campuses in Shunyi, Daxing, Fangshang and other suburban districts.
BUCT’s new campus is located in Nankou Town, Changping, and sits on a land area of 1,800 mu, some 40 km from the city. It is a key project of Beijing’s shifting and relocation of non-capital functions.
The new campus was constructed in three phases. Phase I is now entirely completely, and Phase II is expected to commence by the end of the year. On completion, the learning and living requirements of close to 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students as well as faculty staff are expected to be met.
At this time, a review of this year’s film market will show that fans of the original book of a film adaptation and those of the actors taking part in film have become key components of the expected audience of the film.
At 17:10 today, the 119 command center at Shaoyang received an emergency call. Tetrahydrofuran stored at Hongzhi Chemical Plant at Longxutang, Shuangxi District, caught fire.
Shaoyang fire station immediately dispatched five detachments and 20 fire trucks with heavy chemical protective clothing, chemical cleaning vehicles and other equipment to the scene.
Preliminary investigation revealed that the cause of the fire was the small tanks in which tetrahydrofuran was stored. There was thick smoke at the scene.
At the time of filing this report, firefighters were in the processing of carrying out emergency rescue. The City’s health, safety administration, environmental protection, public security, traffic and other departments arrived at the scene successively. No fatalities or injured persons were found.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to better her own.
She has not accepted responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."

The players’ self-confidence and grasp of the game have increased significantly. Their exchanges with other teams were also more comprehensive, and exchanges both on and off the court have also increased and were more relaxed.
After the competition ended, captain Jiang Cuo said that he hoped to gain experience from taking part in the competition, and do his best for Tibetan basketball.
It is understood that during the competition, the players had to overcome factors such as low altitude sickness, displaying the image of Tibet.
The fact that track and field involves the most gold medals in the Olympics makes those athletes confident a lot, the famous players have been disadvantaged in the competition.
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.
Taking a couple of years, or even a few years, to make a film from planning to release is nothing unusual.
“Big Fish & Begonia”, an animated feature film 12 years in the making, recently announced that it would be released on July 8th.
Liang Xuan, the author of “Big Fish & Begonia”, dropped out of his studies at the Department of Thermal Engineering at Tsinghua University when he was 21, and founded B&T together with best friend Zhang Chun. In 2008, Ce Yuan Ventures provided US$1 million in risk investment, kick-starting the maiden animated film, “Big Fish & Begonia”.
The film was already a recipient of multiple local and overseas awards at the creative sample stage. It has been included in the Centre Pompidou’s collection and acclaimed as “an outstanding artwork”.
As it took six years from creation to production, the film was known as a “super deceiver” by millions of fans who were looking forward to its release.
“Big Fish & Begonia” is a Chinese fantasy. The announcement of the trailers for the scheduled release has once again led to new expectations among all viewers.
Liang Xuan said, “I’ve only done this one thing in the last 12 years. Now it has turned from a dream into reality. I’m both nervous and excited”.
Zhang Chun said, “I kept thinking of using one-fiftieth of other people’s budget to come up with an image effect that was completely identical to these other people’s. I drove our entire team up the wall.”
Dongguan, the “Factory of the World” which once made its fortune on industrial processing and large numbers of general workers, is looking to high-level talent to help the city reposition itself.
The Dongguan government recently held a high-level talent week event. Reporters from China Business Network noticed a number of reputable local enterprises participating in the talent fair.
On the bright advertising board against a tangerine colored wall, they listed their respective exorbitant price tags.
Therefore, China Television Drama Production Industry Association will work together with the television drama production industry nationwide to sign a self-discipline convention.
Provence lavender under threat from climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."
And a lot is at stake.
As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.
Compared to the sci-fi elements in the movie, the two lead actors said that it was the movie’s plot that attracted them.
On the afternoon of September 5, West China City Daily reporters consecutively interviewed numerous renowned personalities in the cross talk circle, as well as two cross talk artistes. What was surprising was that they were unanimously silent most of the time.
One is a Silver Bear Best Actor, the other, an up-and-coming young actor; “Guilty of Mind” is the first partnership between Liao Fan and Li Yifeng.
A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.
It's important to change their routines, they are told.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.
"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two errors contributed to the killing.
First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.
Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.
He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.
"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.
Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting one's instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape constantly shifts.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.
For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.
Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.
Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a wrenching decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.
And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.
Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"
Size of China’s self drive tourism market may exceed RMB1 trillion by 2020
[Abstract] Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-and-easy travel, self drive tourism has received support from national policies, and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers.
At the same time however, the self drive travel market, the size of which is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion, is confronted with twin challenges.
Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-and-easy travel, self drive tourism has received support from national policies, and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers.
At the same time however, the self drive travel market, the size of which is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion, is confronted with twin challenges. On the one hand, the development of the self drive travel industry is out of step with market demand. Self drive travel organizers such as self drive clubs and travel agents are confronted with meager profits. On the other hand, self drive travel ae confronted with infrastructure and services that are still in their infant stages.
Accounting for 60% of total tourists in domestic tourism, with market size expected to exceed RMB1 trillion
In 2016, domestic tourism numbered some 4.44 billion persons, with self drive travel accounting for approximately 60% of total tourists in domestic tourism. By 2020, the size of the self drive travel market is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion.
Statistics concerning the number of persons engaged in self drive travel published by China Tourism Automobile And Cruise Association showed that the number of persons engaged in self drive travel has continued to grow over the last five years. The share of such tourists as a proportion to domestic tourists has stabilized at above 50%.
At the same time, all regions as well as the State have shown greater concern and support for self drive tourism, this new emerging sector. From 2016 to 2017, a slew of policies and regulations relevant to vehicles for self drive travel, and motorhome and camping tourism have been promulgated.
In July 2017, eight government agencies including the China National Tourism Administration and the State General Administration of Sports jointly issued the “Plans for the Development of Automobile Campsites for Self Drive Sports”. In the same month, in the “Action Plan for Advancing Quality Enhancement and Upgrading in Rural Travel Development (2017)“ jointly printed and circulated by 14 government agencies including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance, self drive travel was mentioned as a priority.
The introduction of policy measures has provided opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self drive travel.
Self drive travel clubs make meager profits; complete industry chain is key
Although there is enormous potential in the self drive travel market, and active guidance from national policy measures, the self drive travel industry is still at its infancy stage.
According to the “2016-2017 Annual Report on the Development of China’s Self Drive Travel Industry”, domestic self drive travel clubs, automobile clubs and automobile enthusiasts clubs number in the thousands, tourists who arrange their own travel itinerary account for a larger proportion. The proportion of tourists who join automobile enthusiasts clubs, self drive travel clubs and other such entities only account for about 15%.
Meanwhile, there are only a handful of online tour companies and traditional travel agencies that develop proprietary products for self drive travel. Many online travel platforms only sell self drive travel products provided by some suppliers. Some self drive travel clubs are also key suppliers.
In terms of organizing self drive travel activities, this encompass various aspects including “board, lodging, transport, travel, shopping, entertainment”. Fragmentation is high, and upstream supply chain heavy. There is also significant randomness in tourist spending.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing XTX Auto Club, believes that self drive travel clubs are similar to travel agencies in essence. The primary earnings model at the initial stage are mainly based on offline activities. The core areas are self drive travel route products and guide services.
However, there is significant product homogeneity in route products within the self drive sector, and the standard of guide services is mixed. Self drive travel clubs are again confronted with the need to restructure.
It is quite apparent that self drive travel is not an independent industry in and of itself. Rather, it is an inter-regional and -industry ecosystem based on movement characteristics of self drive travel. The creation of a complete industry chain is key.
Experts have pointed out that in addition to basic tourist consumption, experience is a more important consumption element.
Hence, with regards to the development of the self drive travel industry, the experience feature should be enhanced. A “self drive travel +” theme as well as self drive travel product IP should be developed.
Scenic routes are not merely roads, and automobile campsites should not merely meet board and lodging requirements
Confronted with the rise in self drive travel, the development of self drive travel infrastructure is similarly still fairly rudimentary.
Li Guanjie pointed out that scenic travel routes are not merely a road. Rather, traffic and tourism elements should be integrated into it. However, building roads and tourism are the responsibility of two separate department. The increase in tourism element by transport departments are still stuck at the level of building rest rooms, information centers, publicity bulletin boards and other such facilities. Their degree of bonding with the tourism is low.
These could draw lessons from the building experience of the renowned self drive route of “US Route 66”,
The design of scenic routes is no longer the most direct and fastest route from the place of origin to the destination but adhering to the design concept of “experience the joy of driving” so as to provide self drive travelers the best enjoyment of beautiful scenery along the route. Scenic routes are able to connect spots and facets of the travel landscape. These would help retain the historical value and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the route. Meanwhile, various thematic activities may also be held to enhance tourist participation and recreation experience, creating economic benefit for the local tourism industry.
In addition to scenic routes, campsites are also important supporting facilities for self drive travel.
However, a Beijing News reporter understands from self drive travelers that few consumers would choose to stay at campsites.
They believe that many campsites are infrastructure and can only meet board and lodging requirements. Considered low class with dull product features, they are unable to meet the multi-faceted demands of self drive travel.
An industry insider who wished to remain anonymous said that a few years ago, enterprises operate campsite mostly for the purpose of acquiring land. After they acquire the land, follow-up development of complementary infrastructure and services have not caught up. These operators are loss-making, and do not have later-stage capital injection. Hence, providing corresponding complementary products proved very difficult.
Consumer groups
Data published by the China Tourism Automobile And Cruise Association in 2017 showed that in terms of age, self drive travelers are concentrated in the 21-40 age group, mostly in the 31-40 cohort. This group has a certain level of income, and are relatively demanding in terms of customized travel. Many are family oriented customers.
A survey in lodging revealed that self drive travelers prefer non-standard lodging.
In terms of self drive travel categories, driving in neighboring areas is the predominant category, accounting for 84. 32%.
Self drive travel overseas is a dream for many, but the proportion is still relatively small.
Meanwhile, with higher consumption demand, tourists who enjoyed self drive “tour of sights” have begun to change their opinion. Instead of “alighting to take photos, and boarding to sleep” during the self drive travel process, they are now more concerned with the travel experience and process.
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'
The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'
The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.
It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.
'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.
Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.
I can count the scales on its sole.'
Reporters understand that adding alginate, humic acid and amino acid nutrient carriers of natural or plant sources into the production process of urea would change modify and enhance the benefit of traditional urea. The alginate urea, zinc fulvate urea and aminoglutanic acid urea nitrogen utilization rate was 5 to 10 percentage points higher than general urea.
In a positive environment, an increase in crop yield potential will be significant; in particular, large value-added urea pallets are quality raw materials for bulk blending fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 London Olympics.
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will start the largest ever security linkage plan.
Earlier, Brazil government has said that a total of 85,000 troops and polices, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 polices, will fight together for the security of the Olympics.
Most troops will be responsible for safeguarding the Olympic venues, while the new 3,000 troops will be responsible for the security of international airports, subway stations and streets.
The polices will patrol around other areas of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio and provided security services for the Olympics.
In addition to the four competition areas, they will also patrol airports and main roads connecting airports to the Olympic venues.
Appraisal mechanisms in the services sector are nothing new. The key to having these appraisal mechanisms play an effective role is to have more effective supervision, rather than being a mere formality.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.
Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."
"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
In that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.
"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.
Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.
There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It all just came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."
Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.
"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Online translation services were actually already available on the Internet a decade ago, and in fact, a very long time ago, there was a prevalent view that “machines will replace human translation”.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.
There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.
When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."
The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.
It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.
"I get goosebumps still talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.
That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
As far as computers are concerned, whether Chinese checkers or chess, defeating humans was already a clinch decades ago.
The president of Croatian Football Association Davao Suk said in an interview that participation in the China Cup is very meaningful for Croatian football, and the Chinese Cup’s bonus was considerable.
Forget purchasing agents! These 8000-plus products enjoy zero tariff
At the regular press conference of the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) held on January 11th, spokesperson Gao Feng said that to date, China has 15 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in force, involving 23 countries and regions, encompassing more than 8000 imported products at zero tariff.
Meanwhile, you no longer have to spend a lot of money to have purchasing agents buy the products you want such as imported cosmetics, salmon from Iceland, red wine from Chile, tropical fruits from ASEAN ....
Currently, China has signed 16 FTAs, involving 24 countries and regions, of which 15 have come into effect, encompassing more than 8000 imported products at zero tariff.
Take agricultural produce for example. The implementation of the FTAs has meant that consumers can now sample affordable agricultural produce from different places of production throughout the year.
For instance, import tariffs have been cut to zero for the following products: tropical fruits from ASEAN such as durians, lychees, and pitaya from 15-30% previously;
salmon from Iceland, from 10- 12%; and
red wine from Georgia and Chile, from 14-30%.
Specialty agricultural products such as beef and milk powder from New Zealand have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs.
Industrial products have benefited as well. For example, import tariffs for some cosmetics from Switzerland have been reduced to zero, while
that for some watches have fallen to 50%, and will fall further to zero in a few years’ time;
products from South Korea such as refrigerators, rice cookers, massage devices, and cosmetic apparatus will now be subject to a lower import tariff of 40%, and fall further to zero in a few years’ time;
and consumer electronics and other relevant products have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs.
Products at zero tariff under the FTAs also include intermediates and raw materials required for the domestic production of end-user consumer goods, which will, to a certain extent, also upgrade the mix of domestically produced consumer goods.
MOFCOM spokesperson Gao Feng said that approximately one-third of China’s total imported products enjoy tariff concessions under the FTAs, of which the majority are end-user consumer goods, thus providing tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reductions in import tariffs of consumer goods
On December 1, 2017, China further lowered the import tariffs of some consumer goods. The reductions covered 187 eight-digit HS codes comprising food, health supplements, pharmaceuticals, chemical products for daily use, clothing, footwear and headgear, home appliances, culture and recreation, miscellaneous and sundry goods, as well as other consumer goods.
The average tariff rate of these consumer goods more than halved, plunging from 17.3% to 7.7%!
With effect from January 1, 2018, partial adjustments were also made to other import and export tariffs.
The import tariffs of lipstick, eye shadow, perfume and some other cosmetics fell from 10% to 5%.
This decline in tariff rates means that consumers do not have to have a purchasing agent or travel overseas to buy the foreign products they like.

Foreign press: Year-end return policies at US malls vary widely; be cautious when returning gifts
China News Service, December 29
US-based “World Journal” reported that there was a wave of gift returns just after Christmas.
A report by American Broadcasting Company (ABC) revealed that approximately half of the goods sold last Christmas were exchanged or returned.
Elsewhere, readers had repeatedly reported having been cheated while shopping online. Shoppers should be on their guard when shopping at unofficial websites.
In general, large shopping companies have official and reasonable return procedures, but if you have shopped for gifts at certain small stores or online, you must be careful.
A Madame Hou of Rowland Heights bought a jacket from an online store specializing in print jackets for more than $60 (USD, the same hereinafter) on December 1, local time, but has yet to receive her purchase.
She sent an email to customer service but did not receive any reply from the store.
Elsewhere, a netizen revealed that when on tour in the US last year, he bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller, but received a box of plasticine on delivery instead.
After he realized he was deceived, he applied for a refund from the website. Fortunately, he was able to receive a full refund.
Nonetheless, some customers felt that website refund services are not perfect.
Mr Wang, an ethnic Chinese resident of Northern California, purchased goods at a certain website on urgent delivery services twice at a cost of $4 each but both times, the goods failed to arrive promptly.
He applied for a refund subsequently but did not get a reply.
Large department stores or shopping malls have better return policies.
Most of Macy’s merchandise may be returned for a full refund within 180 days,
but the merchandise has to be in its “original” state, and the customer has to produce proof of purchase such as the receipt or the bank purchase record.
Without proof of purchase, the customer may also receive the store’s credit which may be used to purchase other merchandise.
Target has a 90-day return deadline for general merchandise. For electronic products, the deadline is normally 15 days,
but it is extended to 30 days for electronic and entertainment related products purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017;
note that the 30-day return deadline begins on December 25, i.e., merchandise purchased must be returned by January 25, 2018.
The ultimate shopping experience with the advent of a new era in commercial district shopping development
More than 10 years ago, China was, on the whole, still a sellers’ market. Selection was limited, and so was demand.
A decade hence, the market has long developed into a buyers’ rather than that of a sellers’ market. Shoppers have now become a lot more demanding as well, and are no longer satisfied simply with a “cash on delivery of goods” shopping behavior.
Therefore, how to offer shoppers the ultimate shopping experience has become the next competitive point for real estate developers.
Of the many factors that affect a shopper’s shopping experience, the impact of shopping centers in business districts is the most important.
Let’s take a look at how urban builders focus on the shopping experience.
No two leaves are alike, nor can one find two completely identical shopping malls. A famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.
Take Turkey’s world-renowned Kanyon Shopping Center. Its unique undulating architectural design was inspired by the Grand Canyon, hence its homophonous name Kanyon. You feel like you’re in the Grand Canyon when walking along the 200-meter footpath in the midsection of Kanyon.
In addition to the canyon-like design, there is a large unique inward concave oval-shaped performance venue in the middle of shopping center where specialty performances are often held.
Its open platform design offers visitors at every floor a view of the activities held in the “canyon”, and the scene changes as you take each step.
In China, the Nanjing Forest Mall Commercial Street, known as the country’s first forest style pedestrian consumption venue, is a perfect integration of shopping and ecology as well as fairy tales.
With a 7,000 sqm green plaza, and a 3,000 sqm rooftop water feature, the project is made up of nine individual buildings, linked by a sky bridge. The sunken garden design for the entire project, plane trees as its architectural surface, and the rooftop water feature create the feeling of being in a forest.
On entering the Forest Mall, you’d feel like you have accidentally fallen down the rabbit hole in Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland. The tall tree trunks surround the buildings, and the lawn and stream are beautifully juxtaposed, drawing the masses into a forest full of life and vitality.
Then there is Chonqing. The Lijia Waterfront Business District built by Longhu Properties has plans to attract a diverse range of businesses, and expects to bring in more than 50 world class flagship stores, with more than 100 world class brands and over 500 renowned foreign and domestic brands so as to create a commercial center with a distinctive theme that brings the services sector together.
In addition, the Lijia Waterfront Business District will also integrate ecology into architecture. Based on a transit-oriented development (TOD) concept, it integrates shopping, household services and amenities, dining, entertainment, education and sports, providing shoppers the ultimate shopping experience while affording them the luxury of enjoying Chongqing’s unique “waterfront culture”, a perfect blend of shopping, and water entertainment and recreation.
From the above examples, it is noted that, at present, a number of real estate developers have noticed the discovery of this new urban business phenomenon. Insiders indicate that this consumption model which is centered on the consumer experience and which explores the means to combine shopping and experience will become the mainstream of urban development in the future.
Today’s business districts are no longer merely the distribution centers of goods. Rather, they are more integrated venues that bring together the arts and culture as well as creative themes; they also carry the responsibility of the masses toward urban living.
Therefore, in addition to meeting the one-stop material needs of dining and entertainment of consumers, maximizing the transmission of multi-tiered cultural and artistic spiritual needs, as well as bringing the livable qualities of residential needs into play will inevitably become the high point of future business district development.
In Chongqing, Guoxing Property’s Beianjiangshan is located north of the Yangtze River, close to Guanyin Bridge, where the who’s who of world business and international giants agglomerate, and first class brands congregate, affording a seamless connection with international fashion.
Here, prosperity abounds, and the best in the world agglomerate.
Dongyuanjinyue, which is in the immediate vicinity of Nanping Business District, has a better shopping environment. At its sole disposal is Western China’s, and indeed, the nation’s leading four-story three-dimensional transportation system, enhancing shopping comfort.
Elsewhere, the landscaped gardens and shops along the two pedestrian streets at Huigong Road and Wanda Plaza have been upgraded, with approximately 300 trees planted, and 40,000 sqm of floor space revamped, lifting the image of Nanping Business District.
Meanwhile, Longhu’s Waterfront City, in the immediate vicinity of Chongqing’s first low-density waterfront business district - Lijia Waterfront Business District - is surrounded by nine parks. The commercial street district is low density with good access. These qualities have made shoppers more willing to stay, stop and slowing savor the joy of shopping when shopping, rather than being jostled by crowds of shoppers into rushing forward. Here, “shopping at a leisurely pace” is truly achieved.
Competition will only intensify going forward. In a market of rampant homogenization, how to achieve success, and attain a reputation as a “shopping mecca” in the hearts of future shoppers deserve serious consideration among all real estate developers.
A differentiation strategy alone is far from sufficient. Only developers that truly place shoppers in their hearts, empathize with shoppers, and offer shoppers an ultimate yet simple shopping experience will be able to stand tall in a market when assailed by intense competition.
To be sure, I believe that, at the end of the day, Chongqing’s residents are the happiest lot to have such excellent shopping experience and business districts. A decade ago, no one would have imagined today’s prosperity.
Shopping carnival: Consumerism revelry masks true environmental cost
RMB168.2 billion. That was the amount of money Tmall users spent over a 24-hour period on November 11, 2017 at the “Tmall 11.11 Global Shopping Festival”.
Specifically, in the span of three minutes right after the “Double 11” commenced, Tmall’s transaction volume surpassed RMB10 billion, and exceeded RMB20 billion in six minutes and five seconds; within nine hours, it broke through the RMB100 billion mark.
That day, shoppers all over the world made a total of 1.48 billion payments by way of Alipay, an increase of 41% year-on-year.
Such spending resulted in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether the Tmall shopping platform or the Alipay payment platform, however, both belonged to Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have imagined that the “Singles’ Day” subculture which was a self-deprecating celebration created by singles on November 11 would be co-opted by e-commerce merchants, and turned into a phenomenal “Singles’ Day” shopping carnival today.
Alibaba used the “Great Singles’ Day Sale” marketing gimmick: Not dating? Singles, come shop online - for the first time on November 11, 2009.
The outcome was a surprise. That day, transactions at Taobao Mall (the predecessor of “Tmall”) surpassed RMB52 million, 10 times that of the normal daily transaction value at the time.
From then on, “Double 11” has become a shopping festival created by Alibaba, and has grown and expanded from a domestic buyer-seller amusement to an inflow of global merchants. Nine years hence, and the more than RMB100 billion worth of transactions of Tmall’s “Double 11” is now more than 3200 times that of the first year, far outstripping that of “Black Friday”.
Numerous e-commerce merchants have followed Tmall’s “Double 11” sales promotion, with “JD.com” the strongest competitor.
“JD.com” has its own shopping festival “6.18” but its impact is less than that of “Double 11”. From November 1 to 11 this year, “JD.com”’s accumulated sales amounted to RMB127.1 billion.
The “Double 12” discount extravaganza and the Christmas-New Year shopping period come right after “Double 11”.
Following the New Year, pre-Spring Festival’s Lunar New Year shopping as well as Valentine's Day shopping await the Chinese consumer. Retail consumption knows no holiday.
Massive instantaneous consumption has led to environmental problems, which has attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
A Xinhua Daily Telegraph report revealed that based on the industry’s general standard conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per packaging cartons, at least 300,000 tonnes of trash were generated during this year’s “Singles’ Day” period.
Liu Hua, Director of the Pollution Prevention Program at Greenpeace East Asia told chinadialogue that the volume of orders at this year’s “Singles’ Day” from Tmall alone would generate 160,000 tonnes of packaging trash.
In 2016, the State Post Bureau published a report stating that approximately 780 million items were delivered by express couriers during the 2015 “Singles’ Day” period (November 11-16), with more than 3 billion woven bags, 9.922 billion packaging cartons, and 16.985 billion meters of adhesive tape used. The length of adhesive tape used could go round the equator 425 times.
This year, the State Post Bureau estimates that the “Singles’ Day” express business volume could surpass 1.5 billion items.
Wang Shi, manager of a waste incineration plant in Beijing told Xinhua News Agency that more than 2,000 tonnes of trash enter the plant each day after “Singles’ Day”, exceeding the treatment capacity of the incineration plant.
Express delivery companies have also become aware that the environmental pollution resulting from the express delivery sector should not be ignored.
Some e-commerce logistics enterprises, including Suning, have introduced plastic express delivery boxes that may be recycled and reused ahead of “Singles’ Day”, as well as recyclable packaging such as shopping bags and trash bags that may be used repeatedly. However, acceptance among consumers who could not be bothered was low.
Jack Ma, on Weibo, has also called on the logistics industry to support “green packaging” and “green logistics”.
This Weibo received more than 68,000 “likes”.
What sort of mobile payment do Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war waged in Germany is nothing new.
All WeChat Pay and Alipay did was to move the battleground to Europe. Neither the competitors nor the battleground has changed - the Chinese; is this really globalization?
Where there’s Alipay, there’s WeChat Pay.
According to the agreement with Germany’s electronic payment services provider Wirecard, WeChat Pay officially entered Germany in November this year. The Chinese company has also gradually expanded its presence among merchants in Europe.
This time round, the reunion of the two “fellow countrymen” in a foreign country took place in Europe.
All along, Alipay and WeChat Pay have been riding high on the road to globalization.
In a study on China’s mobile Internet payment’s globalization methods, iResearch Consulting’s “2017 China's Third-Party Mobile Payment Report” arrived at two methods: The first method would be by way of strategic investment, outward transfer of experience, taking an equity stake, and supporting the overseas local mobile payment enterprise;
the second method would be by way of promoting mobile payment services to overseas merchants through Chinese tourists’ overseas spending behavior, thereby changing overseas local entities’ recognition and acceptance of China’s mobile payments.
Indeed, win over the Chinese, and you win the world.
China’s rapid economic growth coupled with its large population base have meant that spending by Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure,
but this also means that the mobile payment war waged in Germany is nothing new.
All WeChat Pay and Alipay did was to move the battleground to Europe. Neither the competitors nor the battleground has changed - it’s still the Chinese; is this really globalization?
A more groundbreaking inquiry would be whether China’s mobile payment can expand its territory in Europe.
Germany is an example.
Magical “new retail”
Chen Xinlei, Yang Kaihan: When Amazon made it to the world’s top 10 list of retailers, it announced that it would venture into the bookstores and grocery stores; this is worth pondering, both in terms of opportunity and motive.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle. This was followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened its bookstore and New York, and planned to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that its checkout-free grocery store Amazon Go would begin trial operations. No waiting in line or checkout is necessary. All customers have to do is scan their QR code on the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take the products they want and leave. The shopping amount would be charged to the customers’ Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, its sudden but frequent forays into physical stores in the last few years have been very unexpected.
This is because way back in 2007, CEO Jeff Bezos, in his “Letter to Shareholders”, highlighted that Amazon would not arbitrarily start a new business (such as a physical store) unless the four conditions set out below are met simultaneously:
1. We must convince ourselves that the new opportunity can generate the returns on capital our investors expected when they invested in Amazon;
2. we must convince ourselves that the new business can grow to a scale where it can be significant in the context of our overall company;
3. we must believe that the opportunity is currently underserved; and
4. we have the capabilities needed to bring strong customer-facing differentiation to the marketplace.
Bookstores and grocery stores are the two most precarious physical retail sub-sectors, and were the first to be knocked out after the rise of Amazon.
When Amazon made it to the world’s top 10 list of retailers, it announced that it would venture into these two physical markets; this is worth pondering, both in terms of opportunity and motive.
Did Amazon do something in contrary to the guarantee it made in its letter to shareholders?
Similar words were echoed at the other end of the world. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at The Computing Conference 2016 held in Yunqi, Hangzhou, Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma said in his keynote address that,
“From next year onward, Alibaba will no longer talk about ‘e-commerce’.
The era of pure e-commerce firms will soon come to an end. E-commerce will no longer exist in the next 10 to 20 years, replaced instead by ‘new retail’.
Only by combining online and offline operations will new retail come into being.”
In an instant, it was as if the words “new retail” took on magical properties, and became the new catchphrase of industry insiders.
So what is “new retail” exactly?
If it merely referred to online-offline integration, then the concept is nothing new.
In 2016, eMarketer, after tracking 180 of the largest e-commerce firms, estimated that total sales of e-commerce firms amounted to approximately US$200 billion, of which the largest 25 accounted for more than US$159 billion;
and of these 25, 18 were traditional retailers that had only begun online operations in the preceding five years (such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, Target and Gap).
Indeed, Alibaba Group's RMB28.3 billion acquisition of an equity stake in Suning Commerce Group was still fresh in the minds of the public.
From a global perspective, both retailers and e-commerce firms are transforming from a single channel to a multi-channel retail system that encompasses physical stores, e-commerce, mobile terminals and social media.
Could Jack Ma’s “new retail” be more of a conclusion rather than a forecast for the future?
If not, then what is the difference between the multi-channel concept and “new retail”?
Perhaps, the crux of the matter is not whether online and offline entities would integrate, but how.
A review of the retail sector in the last 20 years has revealed that the rise of e-commerce was similar to the emergence of discount retailers many years ago; both were focused on price and convenience.
On the basis of these two trigger points, e-commerce firms moved highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, online from offline.
As online retail habits formed, and customer experience continued to rise, e-commerce firms further extended their scope to other product categories, and began to increase efficiency.
In Aliababa CEO Daniel Zhang’s words, “Use the thinking behind and technology of the Internet to thoroughly reform and upgrade the approximately 30 trillion retailers in society at this time, so that the increasingly demanding retail requirements of Chinese consumers may be effectively met. This will make the entire goods production, circulation and services process more efficient with the extensive application of the Internet and big data.”
Thus, the path of e-commerce firms is asset-light on the surface, but asset-heavy in reality.
“Light” refers to fixed assets, headcount, management processes and other burdens that are less than that of traditional retailers; “heavy” refers to areas such as logistics and storage that require enormous investment.
Changes in logistical methods ensured the efficiency of e-commerce firms.
The Chinese Central Government’s official web portal reported that Premier Li Keqiang presided over the State Council executive meeting held on April 28, which was of the opinion that expanding domestic consumption was a key measure for stable growth and structural transformation.
The meeting determined that relevant departments should promptly put forward specific plans on the basis of scientific evaluation.
The import tariffs of some foreign goods for daily use for which domestic consumers have enormous demand will be lowered on a trial basis with effect from June this year, and tariff reductions will be extended to more goods over time.
Together with the tax reform, consumption tax policies for general consumer goods such as clothing and cosmetics will be optimized, with overall adjustments made to the scope of taxation, tax rates, and the different parts of the taxation process.
More port of entry duty-free shops will be set up and restored, and the variety of duty-free goods will be expanded appropriately, with the value of duty-free shopping increased by a certain amount so that domestic consumers would find it convenient to purchase foreign products in China.
Shopping and customs clearance, as well as tax refund for foreign tourists would expedited, and the requirement for voluntary tax declaration of imported goods shall be strictly implemented according to the law.
Policies that support the inspection and quarantine of cross-border e-commerce imports shall be formulated, and unreasonable fees pertaining to imports shall be put in order.
The program to promote the brands of Chinese products shall be accelerated, the development of physical stores supported, and online-offline interaction achieved.
Market order shall be normalized, and strong measures shall be taken to crack down on counterfeit and shoddy products so that the survival of the fittest will be advanced.
Consumers will be able to shop without having to go far, with comfort and ease of mind, and convenience.

On January 18, Alibaba held an e-commerce poverty eradication summit in Chongqing, and announced that it would explore a new “Internet + Poverty eradication” model to help spur measures targeted at eradicating poverty and revitalize the rural economy.
This follows Alibaba’s rural strategy, launch of the Rural Taobao program, online rural revitalization and poverty relief platform, as well as the founding of the Alibaba Poverty Relief Fund, and is a step-up commitment by Alibaba toward combating poverty.
Combating and eradicating poverty is presently one of China’s key national strategies.
Complete eradication of poverty is unprecedented in the history of China.
“Poverty relief via e-commerce is a new round of innovative measures aimed at poverty relief and development. It is an important means to achieve measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication.
The Central government very concerned with this issue and has indicated that the Internet can play a part in helping to combat poverty, advance measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication, as well as allow agricultural products to be sold outside the countryside via the Internet.”
As such, Alibaba had proposed a rural strategy as far back as 2014, which together with big data cloud computing and globalization are its three major core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Alibaba launched the Rural Taobao program, recruiting “village partners” to help lift villagers out of poverty and move toward affluence by way of e-commerce.
In 2017, Alibaba worked together with the Ministry of Commerce to create a rural revitalization and poverty relief channel that is now connected to a total of 13 provinces and 120 national level poverty-stricken counties.
The Alibaba platform has incubated 2118 Taobao Villages,
of which close to 400 have emerged in poverty-stricken counties of various provinces, and 33 in 13 poverty-stricken provinces.
In 2017, at Alibaba’s China retail platform, nationwide sales of Taobao Villages amounted to RMB120 billion.
Daniel Zhang said that confronted with the national strategy to combat poverty, Alibaba has been thinking about how it could effectively use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative competencies within the Alibaba economy to help develop a new path for poverty eradication.
Rural Taobao, in particular, is a major platform to help eradicate poverty via e-commerce, and has opened up a new online direct supply and sales link to help eradicate poverty.
At planting phase, Rural Taobao and Ant Financial Services have jointly offered means to acquire agricultural resources and tools as well as obtain micro-loans.
In 2017, of the 832 national-level poverty-stricken counties, 795 were served by Ant Financial Services, which provided convenient payments, credit and other relevant services.
Cainiao helped with warehousing and logistics, while Tmall was responsible for selling. Alibaba Cloud’s big data provided feedback and guidance on agricultural production, further raising the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of the agricultural produce.
The growth in poverty eradication via e-commerce not only requires products, sales channels and industry planning, it also requires talent.
By way of the e-commerce courses conducted by Taobao University, Alibaba teaches farmers standardized, quality and large-scale methods of cultivation, achieving a combination of “Poverty relief + Knowledge support” so that poverty eradication among farmers is sustainable.
These courses have already reached approximately 92% of national-level poverty-stricken counties.
The “philanthropic mentality, commercial means” poverty eradication thinking can also ensure that Alibaba will “genuinely perform poverty relief” when carrying out poverty relief activities.
Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma once said that eradicating poverty should be divided into three phases - poverty relief, poverty eradication and becoming affluent.
Poverty relief is to give someone a fish; poverty eradication is to teach someone to fish; and becoming affluent is to build a “fish pond” for farmers so that farmers can breed fish.
Poverty relief through industry development led by e-commerce is building that fish pond.
In terms of poverty relief through industry development, Alibaba has partnered Luochuan County in Shaanxi Province to create a Luochuan apple poverty relief through industry development model, which has been replicated and promoted nationwide as a model by relevant departments.
Alibaba’s poverty relief via e-commerce initiatives have also won the recognition of decision makers.
E-commerce firms, represented by Alibaba, have been given the message that farmers would see an increase in production and income with the help of online and offline channels.
Some village partners and Ant Financial staff have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their poverty relief via e-commerce experience.
Currently, the China office of The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has already partnered Rural Taobao in implementing a poverty relief through industry development program in Anhui and other areas.
Sina Finance news. The “3rd New Economy Think Tank Summit” jointly organized by Ali Research Institute and the China Visionary Think Tank Forum was held on January 16. Zhang Li, deputy director of the e-commerce research department at the Ministry of Commerce Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation attended and addressed the Summit.
She believed that our globalization had in fact ignored the most fundamental issues, i.e., those related to the essence and form of globalization, as well as issues associated with phases of globalization.
As a result, many believed that globalization has stagnated. Moreover, in the new phase, many developed and developing countries hold different attitudes toward globalization and its pattern.
The second concept is concerned with issues related to the intermediate phase of globalization. What constrains the intermediate phase of globalization?
The reason why globalization is constrained by the economic environment and fundamentals is precisely because changing economic fundamentals have led to constraints on globalization.
Zhang Li believed that adjustments to the global economy have generally come to an end at the end of 2017. A new growth phase, will begin in 2018, and growth will be driven by producer goods.
JD’s first fresh food supermarket 7FRESH officially opened for business recently, and plans to set up more than 1,000 stores nationwide in three to five years.
Together with Alibaba’s Hema Supermarket, Yonghui Superstores’ Super Species, Suning’s SUFRESH, Meituan’s Zhangyu Store, and others, “new retail outlets” have begun to emerge in clusters, and have even “challenged” each other on price in this innovative model.
The fresh food supermarket war has escalated, and have become a phenomenal topic in the new retail sector. Just what is new in new retail?
“We will rapidly expand nationwide in 2018, and will open a large number of stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival,”
Hema Supermarket CEO Hou Yi revealed the company’s new approach for 2018 at the 2nd New Retail Summit on the 10th.
“With effect from 2018, Hema will not merely be a fresh produce e-commerce firm; rather, we will be a general household goods and grocery e-commerce firm that meets consumers’ requirement for prompt delivery service.
The core model calls for conduction and experience in offline stores, while genuine sales are done online.”
Unlike traditional hypermarkets and supermarkets, Hema Supermarket is, in the eyes of many consumers, a popular Internet store that is fun and has good food. Some intermediaries have even come up with the concept of “He district housing” (housing within a 3km radius of a Hema Supermarket).
Both online e-commerce platforms and offline retail stores have their respective strengths and weaknesses, and consumers are present at various channels. Therefore, both parties are attempting the multi-channel model.
Industry insiders believe that against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading, more “Hema type” stores will be opened in 2018.
Meanwhile, Hema has continued to widen its product scope, expanding from fresh foods initially into other consumer goods. This suggests that more innovation in the retail market will be forthcoming in the new year.
“For instance, the integrated online-offline business model has attracted consumer eyeballs. Fresh foods supermarkets that have opened across the country have been popular among and welcomed by the masses.”
“Nonetheless, these relationships are useless regardless of how much you talk about them or how cool they are. At the end of the day, it’s all about whether or not you have given consumers a good experience. Only after I have had an experience would I be willing to foot the bill.”
As far as RT-Mart’s feiniu.com CEO Yuan Bin is concerned, under the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed; and shopping requirements have changed as well.
Originally, there was a clear demarcation between online and offline; offline wanted to defeat online, and online wanted to counter-attack offline. Now, on the other hand, it’s become a partnership, because consumers no longer see a difference between online and offline.
Capital, competing for a slice of the pie, has made the retail market, represented by fresh food supermarkets, a powder keg.
Analysis shows that at present, new retail competition in Tier 1 cities is still a long way from a red ocean situation, and there is still plenty of Tier 2 cities yet to be explored. Enormous opportunities and potential exist in the market.
New retail plans proposed by different types of industries will lead new retail development into a state of diversified growth.
CCTV-2 and the National Academy of Economic Strategy, CASS have compiled a stack of dry goods, i.e., this weighty annual report on the development of the e-commerce industry in China.
What sort of report card did China’s e-commerce industry receive this year?
What are the growth trends of the global e-commerce industry?
Let us reveal the results one by one.
Total sales volume set a new record while growth returned to the acceleration track
China’s online retail sales have been sky rocketing since 2006. This may be attributed to the fact that online shopping was still a very novel idea at the time. Shopping without leaving home; cool!
Since 2013 however, the online retail sales growth rate has decelerated from more than 50% to less than 40% for the first time in 2015; in 2016, the growth rate was 26.2%.
The situation changed this year, however. Online retail sales accelerated again. For the first nine months of this year, growth rate rebounded to 34.2%,
significantly higher than the growth rates seen in 2015 and 2016.
Perhaps shoppers took a detour but eventually realized that retail therapy does wonders for one’s mind and body.
In particular, online retail sales of physical goods amounted to approximately RMB5.08 trillion, while online retail sales of services amounted to nearly RMB1.49 trillion.
This comprised 13.6% of total retail sales of consumer goods, up nearly 3 percentage points year-on-year.
Wake up, students. It’s time to highlight the key points. Online retail sales of services was definitely a major contributor!
Elsewhere, per capita online shopping of French netizens who are obsessed with online shopping amounted to US$1,925. Goods they purchased online are primarily clothing, worthy of being called a nation of fashion lovers.
Who says those who love online shopping most must be young?
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.
Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
So she called in outsiders for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.
"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.
"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.
"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' "
Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."

The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.
For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.
"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.
The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.
"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.
I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."
UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.
If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place."
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) revealed that in the second quarter of this year, residential property prices in Australia nationwide rose by an average of 1.5% to 2%, and were 3.5% higher on an annual basis, the lowest annual growth rate since March 2013.

IT Home reported this morning that Wall Street Journal claimed that AT&T has canceled plans to sell Huawei’s new flagship smart phone in the US.
Huawei’s original plan was to announce this partnership at the CES this week, but AT&T canceled the partnership at the last minute.
In a January 9 response to a Bloomberg reporter as regards this turn of events (January 9 US local time), Huawei said that it would release its new product and specific listing information to the US market.
Huawei indicated that in the past five years, it has already launched high-end products worldwide and in the US market, proving its strength and competence.
According to the earlier IT Home report, Huawei will unveil the “best smartphone you’ve never heard of” in the afternoon of January 9 at the CES held in Las Vegas. The battery life of this model could support two days of continuous use.
Industry insiders generally believe that the flagship mobile phone Huawei will soon unveil is the Huawei Mate 10 Pro equipped with Android Oreo.
Yangcheng Evening News reporter Wang Li. The film “I Am Not Madame Bovary” starring Fan Bingbing, as well as Guo Tao, Da Peng, Zhang Jiayi and others, will be released nationwide on September 30.
Yesterday, the film held a workshop with the theme “Sorrow in Comedies” in Beijing. Feng Xiaogang, Ning Hao and Da Peng attended the event.
Alternating circular and square image composition; the director was simply willful What was special about “I Am Not Madame Bovary” was the alternating circular and square image compositions. In particular, the circular frames shot with a hooded lens were fresh and interesting.
Feng Xiaogang explained, “ This theme was very similar to Director Zhang Yimou’s “The Story of Qiu Ju”, so it’s very easy for many to lump the two together. So I started to think how I should shoot the film using a method no one has used before. Actually, it wasn’t really a very special idea. I just thought it’d be fun to do something a little different.”
Feng Xiaogang said he regarded the work as his maiden work, and learned how to shoot circular frames from the camera people. He even spent a few million to allow the camera people to shoot a 10-minute pilot.
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.
She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.
Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story
In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."
Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.
To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.
Ah, I love archives!"
For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.
Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."
Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.
Just let it go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.
"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."
With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.
He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"
Bloomberg reporters learned that ZTE Smart Auto’s headquarters will be established in Zhuhai, and the company will be headed by Tian Wenguo, Executive Vice President of ZTE Corporation.
All large energy companies are “extremely wealthy”. So which energy company in the world makes the most money?
Yesterday, PFC Energy published its 2011 list of the Top 50 largest listed energy companies. US oil and gas producer ExxonMobil retained its top position with a market valuation of US$406.3 billion, closely followed by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell.
PetroChina topped the PFC rankings twice in 2007 and 2009, while ExxonMobil ranked first place position for the other years.
Three companies from Mainland China made the 2011 Top 50 list. In addition 2nd place PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC were ranked 9th and 15th, respectively.
According to PFC’s statistics, ... Nonetheless, although current oil prices are far higher than that four years ago, PFC Energy’s CEO said that the lower combined market valuation was attributable to a number of factors, including lower North American natural gas prices, and less buoyant global stock markets.
Xinhua News Agency reported that heavily polluted weather will descend on Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and surrounding regions from the 16th and worsen by the 19th. The AQI of three cities in Hebei, namely Shijiazhuang, Xinji and Handan, will be dramatically high.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
There is going to be new US immigration plan to modify Green Card rules, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president.
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Cards to citizens from other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, have financial resources to support themselves and show skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
The inaugural China Fireworks and Firecracker Safety and Environmental Protection Expo will be held in Liuyang on May 29.
The two-day event will be focused on the theme “Technology, Safety, Environmental Protection”. Then, the most advanced fireworks and firecracker machinery, the safest and most environmental friendly fireworks and firecracker raw and auxiliary materials as well as new products in China’s fireworks and firecracker industry will gather at Liuyang.
A large number of experts and entrepreneurs will be invited to this Expo to carry out academic exchanges in the fireworks and firecracker industry, and to share the latest technological achievements on fireworks and firecracker safety and environmental protection.
In particular, the exhibition for mechanized equipment for the production of fireworks and firecrackers as well as safe and eco-friendly products will be held at Dayao Town. Key exhibits include technologically sophisticated mechanical equipment that uses explosive substances to produce fireworks and firecrackers that have been appraised by relevant technology and passed safety verification; low sensitivity, low blast and other safe pyrotechnic compositions; as well as sulfur-free, light smoke and other safe and eco-friendly personal fireworks and firecrackers.
Meanwhile, safe and eco-friendly fireworks and firecracker products used for fireworks displays collectively sponsored by 16 Liuyang fireworks enterprises will be carried out in two phases - product selection and product fireworks display. Excellent new products that passed the early stage of the competition will be used for the fireworks displays at the Liuyang Fireworks Viewing Platform and the Gold Beach Display Site on May 29.
When 2017, which was just around the corner, was mentioned, Zhao Lei said, “After the tour ends next year, I want to go away and be alone to take stock for a while, and write more new works.”
For the purposes of optimizing the environment of scenic areas, and building a beautify Nanyue, the “636” voluntary service team of the Nanyue District Tobacco Monopoly Administration (Branch Company) carried out a “hiking to protect our forests and love our hometown” environmental protection event.
The event received the support of all the cadres and staff of the district Tobacco Administration, and also attracted retired cadres as well as the staff’s families, who came to participate in the environmental protection activities. Three generations of people from the elderly to children worked together, hiked up the mountain to protect the forests, and cleaned up rubbish, contributing their own effort to building a “beautiful Nanyue”.
This voluntary service event was aimed at protecting the scenic resources of Nanyue, and propagating the voluntary service concept of “care for others, care for society, and care for nature”. It also served to teach and pass on to the next generation the virtue of voluntary service.
It is understood that since the “636” voluntary service team was founded in early April this year, the 16 members have carried out a series of voluntary service activities including visiting needy retail customers, helping tobacco farmers care for tobacco leaves, and making donations to the Ya’an earthquake victims, and have become a team of committed voluntary service activists that convey positive energy from their hearts.

The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Yep.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.
"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.
But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.
She also has moods during the day just like real people!
She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.
Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.
And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.
There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.
Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.
They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.
They are pleasant slaves, in other words.
Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.

The last episode of “Hurry Up, Brother” Season 4 has been recorded. Deng Chao, leader of the “Running Man Team” was interviewed via WeChat by the reporters of Shenyang Evening News and syd.com on May 30. From “Super Scholar” in “Running Man” to “Funny Villain” in “Devil and Angel” to “Decadent Guy” Chen Mo, the impression Deng Chao gives to the audience is that of a “flexible transformer”, constantly changing.
Deng Chao said, “I won’t do the same thing over and over again in my acting career. I want to renew myself constantly.”
Trump's great feat?
Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.
Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.
Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.
The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.
There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.
I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.
The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.
So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.
In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.
Oscar Pistorius taken from jail to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has left jail for a hospital visit.
Last year he was taken to the hospital for treatment to cuts on his wrists, which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the cubicle.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Two Bulgarians Were Detained For Illegal Camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Foreign Affairs Ministry announced, quoted by bTV.
A group of illegally camping people, including the two Bulgarians, was detained by the police in Sithonia in the morning of August 1.
The same day they were released, while an investigation is currently underway.
The ministry of foreign affairs reported bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place not intended for the purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court may impose a fine.
On May 18, the Ministry of Finance issued the “Administrative Measures for Special Rewards and Subsidies for the Structural Adjustments of Industrial Enterprises”, and will arrange special rewards and subsidies amounting to a total of RMB100 billion to help advance reduction of overcapacity in the coal and steel industries.
Recently, many local governments including that of Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang have proposed reform opinions on reducing overcapacity.
In particular, many provinces have even proposed to actively lobby the Central Government for fiscal support to reduce overcapacity in their respective provinces.
One proof is that the overcapacity reduction target for coal announced by a mere eight provinces already account for 90% of the coal overcapacity reduction plan nationwide.
At an interview with reporters, Lin Boqiang, Dean of China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University, believed that merely relying on the Central government’s RMB100 billion to “reduce overcapacity” in the steel and coal industries is far from sufficient. More funds should come from local governments and enterprises. How should that be done?
In the detailed implementation rules for reducing surplus coal capacity issued recently by Shanxi Province, it was proposed that Shanxi Coking Coal Group should be restructured and transformed into a state-owned capital investment company, its assets and businesses should be reorganized and consolidated, and a new business model constructed.
The actual funding gap could be 3 times that of the subsidy. Earlier, Yin Weimin, Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, said that initial calculations showed that a total of 1.3 million employees in the coal industry and 500,000 in the steel industry were required to be resettled as a result of “reducing overcapacity”.
Nanfang Daily news (Reporter/Xie Qingyu) The reporter learned from the provincial environmental protection office today that the 2012 results of the environmental protection credit rating of key sources of pollution are being published.
Ratings showed that of the 1,251 enterprises listed on the environmental protection credit management register, 134 were not rated temporarily because of production stoppage, not having been checked and accepted, having been shut down, and/or other reasons.
Of the enterprises that would be rated with a red card, heavy polluters such as those involved in electroplating, printing and dyeing, and prevention and control dominate. A number of waste water treatment plants were also listed.
The provincial environmental protection office said that in order to reflect the principles of openness, impartiality and fairness, it welcomes public supervision, and has publicly released the rating results on the website of the environmental protection office.
During the period when the results were publicly released, the environmental protection office received phone calls, letters, visits and many other forms of feedback from the public concerning such issues, which will be investigated, verified and dealt with by the environmental protection office.

Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.
Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.
Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'
He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.
Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.
"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.
"I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."
The global spree of frigates building If China does not build this type of warships, will it fall behind?
With the recent announcement of the construction of new types of frigates by major naval powers in the world, it seems that frigates have become the focus of attention of the major naval powers overnight. First, Japan has decided to purchase two new frigates in the 2018 annual defense budget, finally making a substantial breakthrough for its DEX frigates program. Later, Lockheed Martin of USA recently published the latest arrangement for the United States FFG frigates program. How about China's plan for building new type of frigates?
With the launching of the latest model of 054A frigate at the end of 2017, the number of 054A frigate has reached 29, approaching the sum of the 053H series frigates. Since the first 054A was launched in 2006, the history of building 054A has extended to 12 years. Building such a large number of high-performance general purpose frigates is very rare in the history. Apart from China, the only comparable accomplishment was made by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s when it built a host of 'Perry' class frigates.
And the reason why it is necessary to build so many 054A frigates is simple, that is, it is affordable, easy to operate, and doing so can make up for the deficiency of Chinese Navel that has beset the Naval for many years.
The 054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years thanks to its high cost performance and good combat effectiveness. With a displacement of 4,000 tons, the warship is equipped with a 76-mm main gun, and shared launching system for 32 HQ-16 and Fish-8 anti-submarine missiles, 8 YJ-83 anti-ship missiles and 1 Z-9 helicopter. Although it was first built in 2006 and was designed even earlier, its combat effectiveness is not too bad even by today's standard. It can be ranked as medium- to high level frigate among all the frigates in the world.
However, it is a warship designed at the beginning of the 21st century after all. Armaments aside, its propulsion system and electronic radar system lag significantly behind the current mainstream frigates in the world. Considering that similar frigates in Europe have been equipped with full electric propulsion, small multi-function phased array radars and large helicopter decks, it is time to develop new models.
Then how should China develop its new frigates? This has a direct bearing on its future orientation and the strategic direction of Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will inevitably aim at becoming the blue water navy, roaming in the vastness of the oceans. It should be able to deploy rapidly in areas that are closely related to China’s vital interests and demonstrate the presence of force. If necessary, it will use powerful combat capabilities to ensure that China’s vital interests in the region are not compromised. So, it seems that the new models of frigates will surely be huge ships that can roam the blue water.
Let's look at the positioning of the new frigates in the future rank and file of Chinese Navy. The future Chinese Navy should be similar to the US Navy. In addition to the necessary offshore defense ships, the other main ships will form an aircraft carrier battle group or amphibious attack group as the situation requires.
The new frigates in the future aircraft carrier battle group should play the primary role in anti-submarine and short-range air defense operations. In the amphibious attack group, they should provide protection to ships. According to these requirements, the new frigates must have strong anti-submarine capability and good mid-range air defense capability.
Based on the above positioning, we can boldly imagine the rough appearance of the new frigates in the future.
First, the displacement will be increased significantly compared to the current 054A model. It is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5000-6000 tons. The ship will be equipped with a comprehensive electric propulsion system that combines a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, improving the maximum speed to around 30 knots and significantly increase the cruise range. As for the weaponry, the 76mm main gun and 1130 near-range anti-aircraft gun will be retained, but a HQ-10 launch system will be added. A shared vertical launching system for 32-48 unit HQ-16 modified missile and Fish-8 missiles will be furnished at the back of the main gun. A large 8-16-unit vertical launching system should be furnished at the middle-to-rear section of the hull for the launch of YJ-18 and new cruise missiles. Hangars and parking platforms will also be expanded for the parking and storage of two 10-ton helicopters. As for the electronic radar systems, the high grade model will be equipped with a small four-sided fixed phase-control array radar developed based on 346A. the low grade model will be furnished with multi-function rotating phased array radar similar to the ones on European frigates.
Thus, the overall level of the new frigates will edge into the world's top bracket, even comparable to the FFG frigates of the USA.
Of course, these are only the author's conjecture on domestically produced new frigates. Only when the new frigates are launched into the water can we know the truth. Let's anticipate the day.

In recent years, our city has encouraged enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national or industry standards as well as regional group standards. An award of RMB300,000 will be given to enterprises that are principals or that participate in formulating standards for the Made in Zhejiang team, and RMB500,000 awarded to enterprises that have passed the Made in Zhejiang brand certification. This is the most generous award given out in the Province, and has incentivized enterprises to benchmark themselves against the standards.
Recently, at the production workshop of Wonly Group, Gao Jian, head of the Group’s companies, and its staff were working together to pack and send a burglar-proof door to Shaoxing Quality Inspection Center as a sample for the Made in Zhejiang team’s benchmarking and standard achievement work.
Just a couple of days ago, Wonly had passed the on-site inspection of the “Made in Zhejiang” certification expert team.
Gao Jian said that the professional team made up of industry technical experts and the quality certification organization commended the Group’s performance in terms of quality excellence, proprietary innovation and other core aspects, and unanimously believed that the Group had achieved the standards in all respects. If Wonly’s product were to pass the subsequent inspection, it will become one of the first enterprises to have achieved and passed these standards.
Wonly Group is but an epitome of standards driving industry toward structural transformation.
Buyang Group and Qunsheng Group are also enterprises in the city that are carrying out the Made in Zhejiang team’s benchmarking and and standard achievement work.
Since our City formulated the Made in Zhejiang standards for the burglar-proof doors industry last year, Xinyue, Simto and other enterprises have also actively applied to undergo benchmarking.
In recent years, a flood of capital has flowed into the film and TV market, and the profile and remuneration of actors have risen rapidly. Producer He Jing once revealed that two actors of a certain hit drama which was being filmed were earning salaries of close to RMB100 million. In the end, they only acted for two days; their doubles took care of the rest of the film.
In the present situation where actors taking on roles in several dramas simultaneously is popular, lead actors and actresses would be at different sets at the same time. This has meant that they would not be able to appear at the same set at the same time. As such, film crews have been forced to use doubles to ensure the film schedule.

Recently, everyone has been talking about the recent changes in real estate policies. Is it true that real estate policies have been loosened? Is the diversification of land supply going to bring down the housing prices?
However, just when we were worried about real estate prices, macroeconomic controls and the future trend of the real estate market, the People's Daily published an important commentary once again. Last time we discussed how People’s Daily had set the tone for the regulation of real estate market through a commentary. This time, the commentary of People's Daily deals with a topic that is more serious than the affordability of housing: can you repay the loan even if you can afford the down payment of a mortgage?
Today, let's discuss the question more serious than buying a house: repay the loan.
I. China's growing housing debt crisis
The People's Daily Overseas Edition published a commentary titled “Awards and Loans: The Joy and Worries of Struggling Young People” on January 17th. The article cited some data from an report on the progress of nationwide financial deleveraging in the 3rth quarter jointly published by the National Laboratory of Finance and Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center in November 2017. According to the report, the leverage ratio of the residents' sector continues to climb, rising from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, an increase of 1.3%, which amounts to an increase of 3.8% in the first three quarters of 2017.
The residents sector accounts for an increasing share of the total debt in the real economy, and the leverage ratio has risen rapidly.
Relevant studies have shown that Chinese households' debts in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, which account for about two-thirds of residents' debts, which is about twice that of business loans.
Among the consumer loans, medium- and long-term loans dominated by housing loans accounted for about 80%, but short-term consumer loans grow faster than medium- and long-term loans.
Moreover, the household debt ratio figure obtained in the study is only reflects the total amount of credit that the household sector obtains from financial institutions. In fact, many Chinese households borrow money from private sources including relatives and friends, creating a large amount invisible loans.
Seeing such data, one cannot help but be stupefied. According to the statistical data of Suning Financial Research Institute, the leverage ratio of Chinese households was only 3% in 1996 and 18% in 2008. But this figure doubled in just six years since the trend of rapid growth of leverage ratio set in, reaching 36.4%. By the third quarter of 2017, the leverage ratio of households has reached 48.6%.
Let's make another comparison. In May last year, HSBC issued an investigation report involving 10,000 respondents in 9 countries.
The investigation was targeted at young people in the millennial generation (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
The report pointed out that China's young people who were born in 1980s and 1990s have a home ownership rate of 70%, far ahead of Mexico at the second place (46%), and twice the US level (35%).
These figures reveals that compared to the problem of being unable to afford homes, the biggest risk of 'Grey Rhinoceros' for Chinese residents at present is likely to be being unable to repay debt.
2. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have analyzed previously, although we have been saying that China’s housing prices are relatively high, China’s housing ownership rate is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world. So the urgent question facing a lot of friends is whether you can replay the loan rather than the question of whether you can afford a home.
A quick review of the real estate market in the world leads to the conclusion that China’s real estate market hasn't experience major crisis except for the localized crisis in Hainan Province as we mentioned before. This is because commercialization of property is a relatively recent phenomenon in China. However, it's alarming to note that the real estate crisis in the United States triggered a global financial tsunami in 2008, just a decade ago.
The blame for the real estate crisis in the United States falls on two financial institutions: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
In the so called 'golden age' of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses with very low down payments to the low-income people in order to expand sales. When the US economy was prosperous, the real estate market was also thriving. However, it did not last long. The stagnation of growth in the U.S. economy caused the income of home buyers to fall, which in turn caused the consumption expenditures of a large number of households began to decline.
Most U.S. families had both financial assets and real estate assets. At that time, almost all household assets of the low-income families were real estates, while the majority assets of the top 20% high-income families were financial assets. As a result, poorer people in the United States have higher debt ratio.
A grave reality is that these people bought their houses when the economy was prosperous, so the money to pay the mortgage is also calculated based on their better income. When the income declined, the pressure on the mortgage increased as a result of floating nature of some subprime mortgage plans. Thus, the real estate problems of these American families gradually evolved into a real estate crises.
Some people cannot afford to pay their mortgages because their incomes were too low. The banks began to take over the houses from the home buyers who had defaulted on the loan, and then sold them at very low prices, resulting in a step-by-step price fall in the area. This vicious cycle caused a further decline in housing prices. When the housing prices had fallen to a certain extent, more and more home buyers found that their house values became lower than their loans. Thus, more and more people stopped repaying their home mortgages, resulting in a large number of bad debts.
In this way, a huge vicious circle formed:
“Economy downturn – incomes fall – some people can’t repay mortgages – banks sell defaulted houses at low prices – house prices fall – more people stop paying home mortgages – banks sell houses again – prices fall again ..."
The problem did not stop there. As house prices continue to fall, a new situation emerged: The money the bank got after auctioning the defaulted house was less than the loan the home buyer owed the bank, the home buyer still need to repay the loan. So stopping repayment does not necessarily mean that you are cleaned of the debt. For example, if you paid a down payment of $600,000 and borrowed $2.4 million to buy a house worth $3 million at the time. When the house price falls to $2 million, you stop to repay the loan and give the house to the bank. After the bank auctions the house, you will not only lost your down payment of $600,000, but also owed $400,000 debts to the bank. You still have to repay the debt.
Thus, with the effect of such vicious cycle one after another, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed and eventually triggered the U.S. financial crisis in 2008.
Therefore, the fact that China’s household debt ratio has reached a high level of 46.8% is a problem that requires great vigilance. Although this figure is still lower than that of developed countries at present, the signs of the problem have already begun to emerge. The central government started to stress the issue of deleveraging repeatedly in the last year, which is a very prescient judgment. If the household debt ratio is allowed to continue to climb, it will inevitably lead to a huge crisis. Therefore, we must strictly guard against the hidden financial risks.
It's no wonder that the central government has set the tone for the real estate market: Houses are for living, not for speculation. The government are taking multiple measures to resolve potential risks, including increasing land and housing supply and encouraging house renting.
For our individual families, we must abandon the mindset of speculating on real estate and make purchase according to our own financial capacities. In this way, we can prevent our families from falling under huge financial burden. A reasonable assessment of one's own income and debt levels is essential for healthy growth of family wealth.

British inventor microchips himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to a medical standard.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted for cats and dogs, and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.
The married father of one now has technology fitted to both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.

White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.
"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.
A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."
Brilliant Metaphors of Xi Jinping about Comprehensively Strengthening Party Discipline
During the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech on January 11, emphasizing that “we should keep marching ahead on the road of adhering to the principle of comprehensively strengthening party discipline and creating a new situation for comprehensively strengthening party discipline”.
With respect to comprehensively strengthening party discipline, General Secretary Xi Jinping has given many vivid and impressive metaphors, so let’s review them together!
We should fight against “tigers” (high-ranking corrupt officials) immediately after we find evidence, and we should also deal with those “flies” (low-ranking corrupt officials) at the same time. We should spread the principle of comprehensively strengthening party discipline to grass-roots party organizations and make every effort to deal with those corruption problems in daily life of the general public.
-- On January 11, 2018, Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech during the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China
Officials responsible for discipline inspection and supervision at all levels should be loyal and determined, responsible, discipline and law-abiding, honest and upright in order to ensure that the power granted by the Party and the people will not be abused, and the sharp sword used for praising virtue and punishing vice will never be covered by dust.

This made Aunt Gao and her family, residents of the Machinery Office dormitory at Minzhu Road in Nanning, very happy.
Neighbors also said that flowers blooming on the money tree is a rare sight. Residents of the housing estate felt that this was very auspicious, and came to take a look out of interest after learning about the matter.
The scientific name for the money tree is “Malabar Chestnut”, a tropical plant native to Mexico. It performs best in warm and damp conditions, and its flowers will only bloom under appropriate conditions such as sunlight, water and nutriments.
Even in the wild where tropical conditions are appropriate, flowers blooming on money trees are rare. It was once said that the “chance of flowers blooming is one in a thousand”.
Yesterday morning, reporters visited the Nanning Machinery Office dormitory at Minzhu Road. Led by Aunt Gao, the reporters saw the money tree.
Planted amid the flower bed of the housing estate, the money tree was about five meters tall, and the branch circumference, at its thickest, measured approximately 30 cm. Its leaves were emerald green and luxuriant.
The flowers bloomed at tips of higher branches, and the flowers that were in full bloom were more than 10 cm wide. The delicate pale yellow filaments were evenly spread out, and the green buds, when burst, curled backwards on both sides. The fine and dense stamens resembled silver threads with gold stars at their tips.
Aunt Gao told the reporters that the money tree has been planted for eight years. When it was first planted, it was about one meter tall; it is now more than five meters tall.
It was originally a potted plant when her son first bought it from the flower and bird market, and was subsequently planted in the flower bed. She did not have to take particular care of it, but would occasionally earth it up.

Shichang Xingbao reported that between 2005 and 2011, the GDP of Anhui Province rose from joint “bottom” to second at one stroke.
However, the Province’s economic growth continued to experience difficulties such as low investment efficiency, and a lack of core competitiveness in its industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the “Economic Blue Paper” of the Province’s Economic Information Center advised raising the quality and benefit of economic growth.
We have made a comparison of some of the representative indices of the Province’s economy between 2005 and 2011 with that of the nation and Central China.
In 2011, in terms of industrial economic benefit, high energy consumption industries such as industrial energy and raw materials, which comprised a relatively large proportion of the Province, had to endure “twin pressures” - they were significantly affected by market volatility as well as overcapacity. At the same time, home appliances, automotive and other leading industries lacked innovation, resulting in slim profits.
Meanwhile, enormous investment did not bring about the corresponding economic benefit, which was a key factor leading to poor quality and benefit in economic growth.
As regards this, experts advised that effective measures should be adopted to incentivize enterprises to innovate. The technical outcomes of Institutions of higher learning and technological research institutes should also be promptly “transferred” to enterprises.
As for low industrial economic benefit, experts said that industry merger and reorganization should be actively advanced, industry structure optimized, and the industry chain extended.

GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.
It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
China News Service Tibet, May 11 wire (Chen Taobin) Nyima Tsering, Deputy Director of the Tibet Autonomous Region Sports Bureau said at the Everest North Base Camp on the 10th that the cleaning up of domestic waste on the northern slope of Mount Everest will move from a public interest action in the past toward a normalized action led by the Chinese government and in which the international community will participate.
On May 10, environmental protection volunteers loaded rubbish that have been sorted onto trucks.
China News Service/He Penglei: In the last 10 years or so, environmental protection issues at Mount Everest have become increasingly prominent as the number of Mount Everest explorers and tourists increased significantly.
In the Spring of 1997, the Tibet Autonomous Region Mountaineering Association initiated the first clean-up on the Northern slope of Mount Everest, cleaning up oxygen tanks and other domestic waste left over from the 1960s and 1970s. This video was also specially broadcast at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto that year, drawing world attention.
According to Nyima Tsering, after 1997, public interest groups arrived successively to help clean up the Northern slope of Mount Everest, but most of the participants were non-professionals.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.

According to the UK media, Admiral William Moran, the deputy director of Naval Operations, said that even though the US Navy was reinvigorating to cope with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States would continue to take the Asia-Pacific region as the focus of its navy -- the Pentagon had expanded the scope of Asia-Pacific region to include the Indian Ocean - Asia - the Pacific.
According to the reports from the site of "Jane's Defence Weekly" on September 24, China and Russia were classified as the strategic competitors in the new national defense strategy, which was announced by the United States at the beginning of the year.
Then, the US Navy recommissioned the Second Fleet to stand up against the Russian activities more directly.
It was reported that these actions raised some doubts and concerns among its allies and analysts. They were afraid that the US Navy might go far away from the strategy of "Rebalancing toward Asia-Pacific", which marked the Obama administration.
However, Admiral William Moran said that the focus of the US Navy would still focus on the West Pacific.
At the round-table discussion, which was hosted by National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington on January 24, 2018, he said: "For us, there are any significant changes. "
Moran said: "The focus remains on rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want to describe it. "
But he admitted that the United States kept close relations with Europe.
He said: "We would continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast. "
Although he pointed out that the overall policy about Russia fell within the terms of reference of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warned: "The Russians might face the demographic and economic challenges, but the history demonstrates that they will become very tough if we have a conflict with them. "
Admiral Moran said that as a part of the comeback action to fight against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy was dynamically deploying the troops into a "new campaign mode". This would help to make the opponents unaware unprepared for the deployments of the American aircraft carrier battle group or other assets at any specified time and place.
He said: "Our Navy and Marine Corps support it -- the concept of unpredictable battle. We should not show up at the same place again and again like clockwork. -- This is our approach. "
It was reported that the first to try this new approach was the "Harry Truman" aircraft carrier battle group, and its early deployment included the working visits to ports and the patrols in areas, where it usually only passed.
Moran said that the US Navy was currently trying to ensure its allies to know that these warships would still patrol in the traditional areas, and solving the logistical problems and family liaison problems for new deployment process.
Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, the Commander of Royal Australian Navy, also delivered a speech in this event to indicate that the Australian army could seamlessly cooperate with the American aircraft carrier battle group.
He said that this situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy had planned to purchase another 9 frigates with the "Aegis" combat system.

Itochu recognized $1.3 billion impairment losses to the investment on CITIC Limited on Friday. Write-downs of this largest enterprise investment was made due to influences of tense China-US trade.
In May 2016, a man passed by the headquarter of Marubeni Corporation in Tokyo, Japan.
Marubeni said that the trade war struck Gavilon, the subordinate American cereal department, which has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Previously, some Japanese manufacturers of heavy equipment and telecommunications companies have warned about the impact of China-US trade frictions when announcing their latest performance, and now these Japanese traders have joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on each other's goods with the price of hundreds of billions of dollars. President Trump threatened to expand the scope of the tariff to more than $500 billion of goods imported from China if the dispute could not be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, the Chief Financial Officer of Itochu, said that the trade dispute might have greater impact on Chinese economy next year.
Itochu and Charoen Pokphand Group invested $10 billion to CITIC in 2015, gaining 20% stock equity.
Hachimura said that Itochu proposed 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) losses to this part of share holdings since it considered the share price of CITIC not to rise again.
Itochu maintains its profit prediction of 500 billion yen of the financial year ended 31 March, 2019.
China imposed a 25% import tariff on the soybeans imported from America in July, to counter the initiatives of Washington on trade frictions.
"Our cereal business has been struck by China-US trade frictions," the Chief Financial Officer of Itochu Nobuhiro Yabe said.
He said that Gavilon has terminated the financial transaction of its account since September.
Pat Burke, the spokesman of Gavilon, pointed out in the statement on Friday that the action of this company was "in the light of internal policy limits and due to lack of market opportunities. "
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to reduction of employment positions.
Itochu maintained its annual profit prediction of 230 billion yen, helped by pulp, papermaking and power generation.
Sumitomo published its profit increase by 16% from April to September on Thursday, emphasizing that "the trade problems between America and China lead to uncertainty. "

Report on November 5 of China News A round-up report: the U.S. midterm election starts counting down.
On November 4, President Trump and his democratic opponents actively "drum up votes" on their core voters.
Both Parties indicated that voter turnout will be a key factor to influence the situation of election.
According to the report, in 48 hours before the Americans went to vote, Trump was busy attending the rally for the Republican candidate, while the former President Obama just arrived in Indiana to rally for Joe Donnelly, the Democratic candidate of the Federal Senate, who asked for emergency help for the situation of election, and to shout out his final pre-election appeal.
On November 4, Trump went to Maycomb, Georgia to rally for Brian Kemp, the state governor of Republicans. He said, "you must go to the polls and cast a vote. "
"The contrast in this election cannot be clearer. "
Voters’ political enthusiasm has boosted to a rare peak and early voting of some states has been far more than usual.
When successive American presidents face their first midterm elections, their parties tend to have fewer members of congress.
According to the new poll released by the "Washington Post" and the ABC News on Day 4, although the Democratic situation of election for the House of Representatives maintains an advantage, the Republicans could benefit from an economic assessment and Trump's strict focus on border security.
The poll indicates that more registered voters like the Democratic candidate of the House of Representatives than the Republican candidate with proportion of 50% versus 43%. However, it still falls down compared with leading of 14 percentage points in August.
According to the other poll made by NBC and the Wall Street Journal, the Democrats still take 7 percentage points ahead of the Republicans.
It is reported that Obama told the crowds at a rally for Senator Donnelly, "When people don't tell the truth, and words don't mean anything anymore, that's going to have evil consequences.
Democracy does not work when people can only desperately tell lies. "
"Now, the only way to stop the behaviors of these Republicans is you and your vote. "
The Democrats face the toughest situation of election in the Senate for decades, and now the Republicans hold more than half (51) of seats.
However, the situation of election in the House of Representatives is relatively advantageous, and the Democrats need to win 23 seats to take control of 435 seats of the House of Representatives.
According to the assessment of analysts from FiveThirtyEight.com, a website for predicting the situation of election, the possibility that the Democrats win the House of Representatives can reach up to 85%.

The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately stopped the actions of manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, and using the plaintiff’s patent.
On October 30, 2018, China Judgment Online published the "First-instance Civil Ruling Paper of Infringement of Invention Patent Rights between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.", which disclosed some details of case in which the Didi Chuxing APP was sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs believe that they are the patentees and inventors of the "carpooling service system and method based on mobile terminals", and the whole operation process of the "ride-sharing" application in the "Didi Chuxing" APP corresponds to the technical solution of the patent protection involved in the case, which formed a patent infringement.
However, during the court’s ruling, Xiaoju Technology believed that Guangdong Pacific was not an eligible defendant. It only provided free downloads of the involved APP "Didi Chuxing" on the Internet, and did not implement the patent method involved. There was no direct or indirect infringement behavior, and it should not be included as a defendant in this case.
Secondly, the infringement of this case was not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the infringement of the patent involved should be the place where the patent method involved in the case was completely implemented. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the court was challenged and the case was requested to be transferred to the court of the defendant's domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the alleged infringement Didi Chuxing APP product on its online platform. It is not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
And the defendant Guangdong Pacific’s domicile is located in Guangzhou, under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant Xiaoju Technology advocated that the case be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial with inadequate evidence. The Court dismissed the defendant Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.’s objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and ordered it assume the acceptance fee for the case.
At present, the other trials of the case have not been announced, and the reporter will pay close attention to the follow-up details of the patent infringement case of Didi Chuxing.
Exclusive Interview with CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: Australia-China Science and Technology Cooperation Achieved Remarkable Results
"China’s science and technology have developed rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by going forward hand in hand in the scientific field. "
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from the China News Service in Beijing, the cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology has shown great vitality from the cooperation in dealing with climate change to the "Eye of Heaven" project.
As the largest national research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many world famous innovative research results in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a lasting friendship that involves the trust of partners and the tradition of long-term cooperation. ", Marshall said.
In May of this year, China’s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope ― China’s Eye of Heaven, installed the world’s first 19-beam L-band receiver.
This internationally most advanced 19-beam feed source receiver is jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on CSIRO’s many years of technical accumulation. When enabled, the FAST survey speed will increase by 5 to 6 times, meanwhile more scientific observation targets will be expanded.
"This is the contribution of CSIRO to FAST. "
In addition to the above cooperations, CSIRO is also working closely with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of Square Kilometer Array radio telescope, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific researches often focused on problems after hundreds of years, and now more scientific research power is needed to solve the problems in front of them. "
Marshall believed that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in their development progress.
For example, extreme weather occurs frequently in the world. Drought and floods have led to a reduction in food production and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population explosion, aging, chronic disease and other problems are also the serious challenges we faced.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused on solving these current problems. "
Marshall said that the key job of Center for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research, jointly established by CSIRO and National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), are observing El Nino phenomenon and La Nina phenomenon, studying the relationships between these two phenomenons and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather. The new species of cereals developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences can overcome extreme weather and can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to accomplish by oneself, it requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today. "
Marshall expressed that the closer the cooperation is, the more likely it is to make breakthroughs. This is also the significance of Australia and China in strengthening cooperation under the framework of the "One Belt One Road".
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly for cooperation in science and technology for us. "
Marshall took the example that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method without using cyanide. Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a way to purify gold with little environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology to China. This is one of the achievements of our participation in the "One Belt One Road" cooperation. "

The revitalization of Northeast China is vital to the overall situation of national development.
Industrial enterprises in Northeast China have a large proportion and a good foundation. For Northeast China, to make innovation means to have development and to plan for innovation means to plan for the future.
It affects the General Secretary's heart that whether the vitality of the old industrial base can be rekindled and released.
Ri Yong Ho, the foreign minister North Korea, told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening the distrust of the United States on North Korea and it was impossible for North Korea to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said on the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken "very kind actions" during the last year, including cessation of missile and nuclear tests, dismantling of nuclear test sites and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies
"However, we haven’t seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If the United States doesn’t trust on us, we have no confidence in our national security. It is impossible for us to unilaterally abandon the nuclear weapons under such circumstances. "
Although Ri Yong Ho repeated the complaints of North Korea about the opposition of United States to "phased" denuclearization, his speech was of great significance because it did not completely refuse the unilateral denuclearization as North Korea had before.
Ri Yong Ho mentioned the joint statement between Jeong-eun Kim and Trump on June 12, and at that time Jeong-eun Kim agreed to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to protect the security of North Korea.
North Korea has always been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that North Korea must firstly abandon nuclear weapons.
The United States also refused to loose the requirements for the international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goals in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue the ‘declaration of the end of the war’," Ri Yong Ho said.
"The thought that sanctions can make us kneel and beg forgiveness is the daydream of the people who don't know us.
However, the problem is that such continued sanctions are deepening our distrust. "
Ri Yong Ho did not mention the second Trump-Kim summit plan mentioned by the US President earlier this week at the United Nations.
On the contrary, he emphasized the three meetings between Jeong-eun Kim and Moon Jae-in, the South Korean President over the past five months and said, "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea, but not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked. "
China announced that it will reduce import tariffs on 1,585 tax items from November 1, 2018.
Since this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1 this year, the drug was fully tax-deducted, and all import tariffs for all 28 tax items of general taxable drugs, including anticancer drugs, and alkaloid drugs with anticancer effects, and Chinese patent medicines with actual imports, were adjusted to zero.
At the same time, it has also greatly reduced the production and import links value-added tax burden of anti-cancer drugs.
On July 1, tax reductions were imposed on 218 tax items of cars and parts.
After the tax reduction, the finished automobile tax rate of China’s automobile has been lower than the average level of developing countries, which is in line with the actual situation of China’s automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive the restructuring of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest to help improve the quality of products and services. It is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, tax reductions were imposed on 1449 tax items of daily consumer goods.
The tax reduction on daily consumer goods is closely bound up with people’s need of better lives.
This time’s tax reduction not only involves lots of items but also has strong dynamics, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
The reduction of taxes on daily consumer goods directly benefits the consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
November 1, tax reductions will be imposed on 1585 industrial product tax items of electromechanical devices, parts and raw materials.
Appropriately reducing the import tariffs of some domestically industrial products with urgent needs can attract more foreign capital, help increase domestic effective supply, assist industrial upgrading, and contribute to enterprises allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and also benefit for reducing the pressure on the domestic environment.
Relevant person in charge of Customs Tariff Commissions Office of the State Council introduced that the above four times initiative tax reduction and the third step tax reduction implemented on this year’s July 1 in accordance with the results of the expansion of the information technology agreement negotiation will result in the overall tariff level fell from last year’s 9.8% to 7.5%.
The adjusted overall tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than most developing countries, at a moderately low level, and basically matches China’s developing country status and development stage.
According to the person in charge, as one of the important indicators of the degree of openness in China’s trade in goods sector, the overall level of tariffs should be compatible with the stage of China’s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China’s trade in goods scale ranks first in the world, and it has already had the economic foundation to further expand its openness. However, there is still a gap between the quality and efficiency of trade development compared with developed economies. Therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately lowered.
Tariff is a kind of protect means for compliance. The level of tariff should be compatible with industrial competitiveness to encourage healthy competition. While overprotection goes against the industry development and quality improvement.
Tariff rate adjustment must balance production needs with consumer demands.
Focus on reducing the commodity tax rate that has a large domestic demand and contributes to the transformation and upgrading of the industry, and striving to increase the import of characteristic advantage products with relatively concentrated needs of the people, continuously improving the sense of gain of enterprises and the public, and meeting the upgrading needs of the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The tax reduction should balance the financial revenue and the affordability of industrial development.
In the choice of specific tax-reduction commodities and range of tax reductions, we must plan and coordinate the domestic and international markets, the upstream and downstream aspects, production and consumption relationship, and maintain the steady development of China’s economy.
The principal stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. China’s initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure based on China’s own needs to achieve high-quality development. It is conducive to the overall planning and utilization of international and foreign resources to promote the quality of domestic supply systems and meet the upgrading consumption needs of people.
This action and measure shows tfhat China will constantly pursue an opening up strategy of mutual benefit and win-win result, firmly support economic globalization, steadfastly uphold the principle of free trade rule and the multilateral trading system centered on the WTO, and continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world to also allow China’s development to better benefit the world.
Serbia announced to enter the top defense readiness condition. Serbian President and Russian President will meet to discuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
Yugoslav news agency reported by quoting sources from the Office of Serbian President that Vucic, the Serbian President, gave orders that the Serbian armed forces entered the top defense readiness condition in consideration of the fact that Kosovo special troops had occupied the roadway to the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station under the control of Belgrade in northern Kosovo.
On September 29, Vulin, the Defense Minister of Serbia, announced that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness condition.
Vulin emphasized that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as Vucic's orders were still effective. Regardless of the direction in which the situation develops, the Serbian army will respond accordingly.
It was reported by the Tass news agency of Russia that Vucic said in an interview on September 29 that he had notified the United States, Russia, Europe and other sides about the current situation, and would visit Moscow on October 2 to meet with Putin, the President of Russia, to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When he was asked whether Serbia needed to get the military support from Russia like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I don't want a significant military conflict in our territory. "
Vucic also said that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness condition just for the sake of deterrence to prevent the conflict. However, it was a clear warning: Serbia would never tolerate any violent action in Kosovo.
The Serbian army upgraded the defense readiness condition in connection with the two actions in Kosovo.
According to the statement of Serbia, the Albanian people were carrying out the mass arrests of Serbian people, who had been living there for generations, in recent days, but these arrested Serbian people didn't break any laws.
Vucic said that since Marko Juric, the head of the Serbian government's Office for Kosovo and Metohija, was beaten and detained by the Albanian army in Kosovo, the Albanian people constantly escalated the issues in the region and carried out the inhumane arrests and deportations of the Serbian people.
Furthermore, over 100 people, including the members of ROSU special army of the Department of the Interior of the self-declared Republic of Kosovo, armed police, and snipers, occupied the battle field near the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station, entered the ecological sport center near the dam in northern Kosovo, and blocked all roads nearby. These areas were originally under the control of Serbia.
Vucic indicated that Kosovo was encouraged by the western countries to make this military adventure. Since the Kosovo army had taken actions without notifying Serbia in advance, it violated the rules in Paragraph 1 in Chapter 9 of "Brussels Agreement", and it also breached the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technology agreement between Serbia and Kosovo.
Vucic had spoken to Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary-General, to criticize the western countries for their false words on the Kosovo issue.
The source of current conflict was still the historical grievances lasting for hundreds of years between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo.
For the ownership of Kosovo, Serbian people and Albanian people had different opinions.
Serbia considered Kosovo as the birthplace of its nation and the cradle of culture, because Serbia had built its most powerful country here in the 12th century. However, the Albanian people settled here in large numbers only after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbian army retreated to the north.
The Albanian people insisted that the Illyrian people of the primitive tribe located at Kosovo in the 4th-5th century were their ancestors. Therefore, Kosovo had been the Albanian people's territory since ancient times.
The subjective political divisions contributed to the sharp conflicts between different nations, religions and cultures, resulting in the fierce confrontation between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo.
The Albanian people in Kosovo first declared the independence of Albania in 1912.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanian people, who were living in the Balkan Peninsula, moved to Turkey. The proportion of Serbian people was relatively rising. The actions of "taking back their own lands" in the sight of the Serbian people were considered as the predations of the "Greater Serbian Nationalism" by Albanian people. The contradiction between the two nations intensified.
Kosovo became the "powder keg" of Balkan.
The Albanian separatists in Kosovo liberation army and the Serbian army and police engaged in armed conflicts in 1999, which led to the NATO troops bombed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia consisting of Serbia and Montenegro. The Kosovo War broke out.
Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008.
Thereafter, the news came out that Serbia and Kosovo would normalize relations, and sign a global and legally binding agreement. However, due to the historical grievances between the two nations and the geopolitical constraints, they failed to sign the agreement, which was in the control of different forces, including the United States, Europe and Russia.
Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he insisted to separate Serbian people from Albanian people in Kosovo. It exposed the conflict between the two nations again.
Power Communication Still in interruption. Difficulties in Rescue due to Strong Earthquakes with Tsunami in Indonesia.
According to figures released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency on the morning of the 30th, a devastating earthquake and the caused tsunami in the Donggala Regency in Central Sulawesi caused 420 people on 28th.
Wilem Rampangilei, head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said that the figure is only preliminary statistics from the Palu in Central Sulawesi, about 80 kilometers from the epicenter. Because of the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery, many damaged and collapsed hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other densely populated buildings due to the earthquake have not been searched and rescued.
On September 29, 2018, in Palu, Indonesia, a bridge damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed into several sections.
Due to the severe damage to power and communication facilities, the epicenter of Donggala Regency and the neighboring Sigi area are still “lonely islands" that cannot be reached, and the number of victims cannot be counted.
According to media reports here, Indonesian Vice President Kalla said the death toll may reach thousands.
Power interruption, communication interruption, road blockage, airport damage... The rescue work after strong earthquakes and tsunami is very difficult.
Due to power interruption, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu rely on fuel for power generation.
The roads entering and leaving the city are blocked due to landslides, and large transport vehicles, including tank trucks, are unable to enter, which makes the fuel supply very tight.
Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus said that due to road damage, the Ministry dispatched emergency relief materials such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food and household goods packages from Central Sulawesi and Gorontalo adjacent to the earthquake region have not arrived in the disaster area.
The disaster relief materials transported from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area through the air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to thecontrol tower and runways of the Palu Airport during the earthquake, all commercial flights have been grounded to ensure the safety and security of the rescue. The airport is only used for the take-off and landing of military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel.
Wiranto, the Indonesian Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who directed the rescue in the earthquake zone, demanded that the power supply and airport commercial flights be restored as soon as possible to ensure the operating of hospitals and other relief agencies, so that more rescuers, volunteers and aids can be transported to disaster areas.
On the 28th, several strong earthquakes occurred in Donggala Regency in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia continuously. The 7.7-magnitude earthquake that occurred at 17:02 local time caused a tsunami, which caused Palu City, Donggala Regency and Sigi area occurred major disasters.
China News Service, Beijing, October 1 (reported by Yin Li) -- A cloudless blue sky in the day and the red clouds at evening......Recently, Beijing kept in the mode of the most beautiful blue sky. Thousands of Beijing residents couldn't help to change tactics to show their pictures on social platforms and constantly make status updates to show their happinesses. They said that "the most beautiful skyline with a blue sky and white clouds was the best business card of Beijing".
Beijing had met the "bluest sky" since August.
It could be found anywhere in Beijing at any time that many residents were holding their smart phones or DSLR cameras to take pictures.
On social platforms, such as the microblog and WeChat Moments, people could see the different beauty of the Imperial Palace, Tian An Men, the Bird's Nest, Hutong, and various buildings against the blue sky in the net friends' cameras.
Some net friends said that such "landscape pictures" were the best city images of Beijing; and some net friends joked that if the blue sky remain the same for a long time, the patients with cervical spondylosis would surely be cured; some net friends even hoped that "the blue sky would last through the winter, spring and summer, providing Beijing with a blue sky across four seasons".
Why did the residents in Beijing particularly like to show the blue sky?
That's because they had been suffering from the fog and haze in this city in the past. They looked forward to the blue sky eagerly. After starting the "Blue Sky Protection Campaign" in Beijing to continuously improve the air quality, there were less fog and haze, but more blue skies. The residents were joyful to see this. And they felt so happy with it.
The weather was fine in Beijing on National Day.
Most of 35 air quality monitoring stations in Beijing showed in green at 8:00 am, indicating the "Superior First Grade".
The photography competition with the theme of the "bluest sky" voluntarily organized by the residents on social platforms was still under way.
Why was the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
As the relevant responsible person of Beijing Environmental Protection Agency explained, the mean concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 35 micrograms per cubic meter in Beijing in August of this year, which created the best record for the same period in history of the recent five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 was even less than 10 in September.
The major factor contributing to the "bluest sky" was the overall favorable meteorological conditions in recent days. And more importantly, Beijing had persistently carried out the air pollution control. It had vigorously promoted the Clean Air Action Plan in the past five years, and the environmental benefits were released continuously resulting in the reduction of total pollutant emission in the region. These laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing released officially and implemented the "2013-2017 Clean Air Action Plan in Beijing" in 2013.
According to this plan, the authority would continue to guide the alleviation of functions unrelated to its status as national capital, and promoted the works of clean energy substitutions and pollutants discharge reductions. 4923 coal fired boilers were eliminated in total.
Thus, Beijing became the first big city of achieving the full network of natural gasification in the Chinese mainland.
According to the data, the annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing from 2013 to 2017 cumulatively dropped by 35.6%; the number of days that the air quality reached the standards increased by 50; the number of days that achieved the Superior First Grade increased by 25; the number of days with heavy pollution reduced by 35 in total, and the occurrence rate of heavy pollution significantly dropped.
With the continuous improvement of air quality, Beijing authority issued the "Three-year Action Plan of Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Protection Campaign" in September on the basis of the analysis of a new round of PM2.5 source. According to the current governance phase and pollution characteristics, it focused on the important prevention and control areas including the treatment of diesel trucks, flying dusts, and volatile organic compounds, optimized and adjusted the transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land-use structure, strengthened the inter-regional prevention and control, enhanced the delicacy management of city, promoted the green development in an all-round way, and strived to keep the "bluest sky" permanently in Beijing. The sky would not "be precious", since it was rare. Let it return to be the background of people's photo album, but not the leading role.
During this year’s National Day Golden Week, the Municipal Tourism Commission, Industry and Commerce Bureau, City Urban Administrative and Law Enforcement Bureau, Public Security Bureau and other relevant departments will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the "six unlicensed" chaos in tourism, and once verified, the violations will be imposed on strict and serious punishment according to the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a thematic meeting on illegal "one-day tour" to deploy a special action to further crack down on illegal "one-day tour".
At the meeting, the focus was on the "six unlicensed" chaos that was intertwined with the unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed travel agency, unlicensed car, tourist trap and unlicensed website profit chain. The city launched a special action for "one-day tour" on July 28th.
Since the launch of the special action, the city has accepted 39 "one-day tour" complaints with a year on year decrease of 63%. Since the beginning of this year, the city has accepted 270 "one-day tour" complaints with a year on year decrease of 62%.
In the past two months, the city has checked and detained 248 "unlicensed cars", investigated and handled 158 violations of the tourist transportation business, shut down 29 shopping "tourist traps" and performing arts venues, investigated and handled 13 "unlicensed travel agencies" and 27 "unlicensed tour guides", confiscated 26,000 pieces of illegal advertisements, torn down 31 pieces of illegal "one-day tour" billboards and 3 pieces of fake bus stop signs, investigated and handled 1789 various types of travel-related violations, and 181 cases were filed by various functional departments with a heavier fine of 4.48 million yuan and 111 travel-related illegal criminals were detained.
After rectification, the illegal "one-day tour" chaos has been basically contained, and the "one-day tour" market order has shown a steady and good trend.
According to the information, the city has continuously strengthen the force of illegal "one-day tour rectification in recent years.
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1,612 complaints and 897 complaints of "one-day tour", a year-on-year decrease of 79% and 44% respectively. Though the crack down actions are contentiously implemented, the illegal "one-day tours" are still recurrent, forming the intertwined profit chains among the "six unlicensed" chaos of unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed travel agency, unlicensed car, tourist trap and unlicensed website.
Specifically, "unlicensed ticket provider" is the person who attract customers on the street illegally, "unlicensed website" is the illegal website providing fake tourism information, "unlicensed travel agency" engaged in illegal "one-day tour" or an institution without business qualification of travel agencies, "unlicensed tour guide" is the tour guide without tourist certificate or practice illegally and employed by the "unlicensed travel agency", "unlicensed car" is the vehicle without tourist transportation qualification used by "unlicensed tour guide" or the vehicle with tourist transportation qualification used for providing passenger service to illegal "one-day tour", and last, the "unlicensed tour guide" will bring the tourists to the specified travel shopping store, that is "tourist trap".
In this special action, the city continued to increase the fixed inspection and flexible inspection of illegal "one-day tour". Focus on the illegal "one-day tour" with high frequency and influential tourist route points, the relevant departments assigned daily secret investigation teams to make investigations with the tour groups secretly, and strict investigation and treatment will be imposed according to the law, if violations are found.
Among them, "unlicensed car" and "tourist trap" have become the two focuses of the serious crack downs in the special action.
According to reports, without "unlicensed cars", the illegal "one-day tour" can not be completed, "unlicensed cars" are easy to be found, remembered and investigated, they are also fixed value with a hinger single value.
Relevant departments used road traffic surveillance cameras to increase the supervision of the tourist buses along the key "one-day tour" routes, and use intelligence measures such as technology prevention and physical prevention to find and investigate "unlicensed cars" in time.
"Tourist trap" during traveling has become a key focus due to its small number and operation in locality.
In order to strengthen the shock and attack on illegal "one-day tour", all the functional departments will impose heavy and strict punishments according to law, once they have verified the violation of laws and regulations.
In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to illegal "one-day tour", and discussed means and methods combining administrative punishment with conviction of imprisonment.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, more formal travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out Beijing "one-day tour" and increase the supply of formal "one-day tour" to further occupy the living space of illegal "one-day tour". The specific plan is still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continuously improved the electronic travel itinerary information system of the tour group to ensure that each group is included in the electronic itinerary platform supervision.
From a tourist symbol to a symbol of digital economy, what has Wuzhen experienced in these years
As the permanent site of the World Internet Conference, the way that Wuzhen undertakes the dividend of the summit attracts much attention.
Since the first World Internet Conference, Wuzhen has obvious changes over the past five years.
In 2014, there were only 12 enterprises related to the digital economy and Internet all over the town. By the third quarter of this year, there have been more than 500 enterprises.
This is a miniature of the development of digital economy in Wuzhen.
The Internet Conference enables local enterprises to accept the enlightenment of the digital economy and the wave of digitization from zero distance. Enterprises have a strong desire to make transformation and upgrade. Traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased investment and research and development in the aspects of machine substitution, intelligent management, etc.
Jiang Wei, the Party secretary of Wuzhen, says that the town will build a new economic empowered center in the future.
The development of digital economy cannot be separated from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen has launched a 5G pilot project based on full coverage of 4G communication networks and free WiFi.

After aggressive treatment, the survival rate of premature infants of 29 weeks and more gestation is 98% in China, which has reached the level of developed countries.
ECNS, Shanghai, September 30 (reported by Chen Jing and Luo Yanqian) -- Children's National Medical Center and Children's Hospital of Fudan University disclosed on September 30 that it had introduced the Canadian advanced method in the leading "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China".
The project result showed that after aggressive treatment, the survival rate of premature infants of 29 weeks and more gestation was 98% in China, which had reached the level of developed countries. However, the survival rate of premature infants of minimum gestation and the survival rate of premature infants without complications still needed to be improved greatly.
During the past 20 years, the Chinese government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.
Currently, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71‰, which is significantly lower than the national average level and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China" has significantly improved the survival quality of premature infants through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, the director of NICU of Children's Hospital of Fudan University told the reporter that it was of great significance for the improvement of premature infants' overall survival quality and population quality to pay attention to the reduction of premature infants' survival quality, reduce the complication rates, improve the neurodevelopmental prognosis, and improve the overall outcome of baby patients while improving the survival rate of premature infants. It was an important problem of concern to the pediatric and neonatal departments at home and abroad, and it was also a critical issue in this project.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China" has included tens of thousands of cases of premature infants of 33 weeks and less gestation in China and has contributed to 1/3 reduction of the mortality rate of premature infants of minimum gestation and small birth weight through four years of unremitting efforts. At the same time, the severe complication rate of premature infants has been significantly reduced and the survival quality of premature infants has been greatly improved.
This project has established a set of complete, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement methods, which are suitable for our domestic conditions and will collaboratively improve the prognosis of premature infants and improve the level of neonatal care by setting up the national collaboration network of national quality improvement, introducing the concepts of collaborative quality improvement, and combing 25 cooperative hospitals in China.
Children's Hospital of Fudan University is connecting the forces of neonatal departments across the country, and developing the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project in order to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections.
It is reported that in the "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China", the pediatric hospitals has introduced the EPIQ methods into 25 large NICU in 19 provinces in order to solve the disturbing problem of neonatal infections in China NICU.
After more than 10 years of constant improvement, the survival rate of premature infants without complications in Canada has increased by about 1/3. Canada is now one of the countries with the best prognosis in premature infants in the world.
The EPIQ methods have been widely applied to all NICUs in Canada, and have been adopted by 6 other countries.
According to the pediatric hospital, the research results show that after implementing the EPIQ intervention for two years, the infection rate of premature infants will drop by 35%, and the usage rate of antibiotics will drop by 20%.
In the future, Children's Hospital of Fudan University will continue to promote and implement these methods in the whole country, aiming at comprehensively reducing the occurrence rates of all complications in premature infants and improving the quality of treatment for newborns in China.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in various regions in China.
According to Professor Cao Yun's introduction, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role as an important construction unit of Children's National Medical Center. This project covers Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and many other western provinces, with the goal of gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal treatment throughout the country.
It is reported that Children's Hospital of Fudan University is connecting the forces of neonatal departments across the country, and developing the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project in order to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections.
It has been revealed that the coordination center's Chinese Neonatal Network located at Children's Hospital of Fudan University will unite 63 hospitals across China to carry out the next stage of national quality improvement in 2019, with the goal of promoting the homogenization of neonatal treatment in China.
Wu Jinglei, the director of Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission, says that Shanghai can become a central city in Asia center. Its research, construction of the entire service system, service quality and service outcomes should have a place in Asia, in order to truly reflect China's medical level.
Xin Shiping: Build the "monument of heroes" in the heart - written on the fifth Memorial Day.
On September 30, on the eve of the 69th birthday of the People's Republic of China, we ushered in the fifth Memorial Day. Xi Jinping and other Party and state leaders came to the Tian'anmen Square to attend the ceremony for presenting flower baskets to the people's heroes.
At this moment, please pay tribute to the heroes wherever you are.
The Memorial Day is not only for reviving, but also for awakening.
Look back the rich history, every martyr’s name represents a fresh life.
They also have fiery youth, sincere love and caring families.
However, for the belief that "the doctrine we believe in is the truth of the universe", and for the purpose to "spare the suffering of the next generation", they are willing to sacrifice everything.
"I would cry for China in each day of my life".
Through time and space, the heroes set up spiritual signposts to guide the way forward.
"Where do you come from and where do you go?"; "What kind of man you want to be?"; It's not hard to have the answers if you understand the heroes.
In memory of heroes, the most important thing is to build a "monument of heroes" in the heart.
According to the incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary wartime, around 20 million martyrs have died heroically for national independence, liberation of the people and prosperity of the country.
Due to various reasons, many martyrs don’t even leave their names.
Countless heroes and martyrs enrich ideals with blood, practice faith with life. To remember their names and inherit their spirit, is to protect the nation's root and soul.
This "monument of heroes" cannot be stained or damaged.
For some time, the historical nihilism, abused entertainment and other undercurrents emerge.
All sorts of actions that distort and disparage heroes and martyrs, challenge just conscience, derange value judgments, and cause the public indignation and vigilance of the whole society.
Heroes and martyrs cannot be desecrated, and heroes cannot be forgotten.
We cannot let actions that touch the bottom line drift. We must dare to show our sword and uphold the dignity of heroes with rule of law and justice.
On May 1, the law for the protection of heroes and martyrs came into force.
From the perspective of judicial practice, the verdict of some cases is to the satisfaction of the masses, which not only effectively maintains the glorious image of heroes in accordance with the law, but also releases the positive energy for respecting heroes and martyrs.
A nation with pursuits cannot live without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot live without pioneers.
It has become a common social consensus to recall the martyrs and call for heroes.
Currently, there are millions of memorial facilities of various kinds in China, and more than 100 million people visit the martyrs' cemetery every year.
The hearts of the people are the strongest footstones.
Let advocating heroes, defending heroes, learning from heroes and caring heroes prevail, and let the spirit of heroes merge into the national blood. The "monument of heroes" will stand firmly between sky and earth and deep in the hearts of the people.
Report of Reuters on September 28 in Brussels: The European Union took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday after Italy looked down upon EU demands and surprised the market with a massive budget deficit plan. But if Italy stuck to a too bold goal, the EU might take a more radical stance.
The aim of Italian Eurosceptic government was that the budget deficit was equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the next three years, suggesting that there was no debt reduction despite deficit reduction requirements.
Moscovici, the executive committee member of economic affairs of the European Commission, said on Friday, "We are not interested in the crisis between the European Commission and Italy," he responded cautiously since the proposals and sanctions of the European Commission might have little impact on Italy.
The officials and diplomats of the European Commission still hoped that market forces would persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy officially submitted it to the European Commission in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while the Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit goal remained unchanged before the deadline in October, the European Commission might veto the Italian draft budget, which has never been done to any country by the European Commission.
Dombrowski, the Vice-President of the European Commission said at a meeting in Riga, the capital of Latvia later on Friday that current Italian fiscal plan "seems to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Convention", which was referred to the EU fiscal provisions.
However, he did not mention how this would trigger a response of the EU.
Bidders may submit their applications for participation in this open tender before October 26 this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture regarded China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
The Russian Agricultural Supervision Bureau announced in May that Russian grain exports to China exceeded 1 million tons for the first time in this agricultural year, setting a new record.
The bureau predicts that China may become the top ten Russian grain importers.

At the crucial moment, the Turkish team made a mistake. After the Chinese team led by 21:19, they won the match point with 24:21 by Zhu Ting’s powerful smash and Zhang Changning’s attack. Then the Turkish team chased the score to 23:24, After the Chinese team requested a time out, Zhang Changning scored by attack and the Chinese team locked the victory at 25:23.
Chinese women’s volleyball coach Lang Ping said after the game that the whole game was not easy.
"We are well prepared, the aspect of block is good, the Turkish team is more comprehensive, we must reduce mistakes and strive to win by ourselves. "
Faced with the familiar teammates in the past, Zhu Ting, who played for the VakıfBank Sports Club, received a lot of restrictions in the first game of the day. Then she took the initiative to make changes and still played a strong offense.
"My opponents and I are very familiar with each other. It is normal to be marked by the opponent, but the Chinese team is playing to the extreme, and the block and the offense are playing well in the case of a bad first pass. "
Next, the Chinese women’s volleyball team will take a day off for physical and technical training; on October 2nd, they will face the third team in the group match, Canada.

Nearly 1,000 national scenic spots have cut ticket prices and the decreasing amplitude of more than half of them is over 20%
[Abstract] As of September 28, various regions have introduced and implemented, or issued a document to publish to the public for measures of free or reduced-price opening for 981 scenic spots (74 spots for free and 907 spots for price reduction). The prices have been reduced in the scenic spots in Yunnan Stone Forest, the Dali Three Pagodas, the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, the Lijiang River in Guilin, Guangxi, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, Terracotta Army in Shaanxi, Mount Sanqingshan in Jiangxi and Kanas in Xinjiang.
In order to implement the deployment of the decision of the Central Economic Working Conference and the Government Work Report, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the Guiding Opinions on Improving the Formation Mechanism of Ticket Prices in State-owned Scenic Spots and Reducing Ticket Prices in Key State-owned Scenic Spots (hereinafter referred to as the Guiding Opinions) on June 28, requiring to improve the formation mechanism of ticket prices in state-owned scenic spots in terms of reasonable definition of the composition of ticket pricing costs, innovative price management methods and strict implementation pricing procedures, to ensure to achieve remarkable results for reducing the relatively high ticket prices in key state-owned scenic spots by the end of September.
Various regions have actively carried out work according to the deployment requirements and reduced a batch of key state-owned scenic spot ticket prices.
As of September 28, various regions have introduced and implemented, or issued a document to publish to the public for measures of free or reduced-price opening for 981 scenic spots (74 spots for free and 907 spots for price reduction). Among them, there are 159 5A scenic spots and 534 4A scenic spots, with a total of 693 and accounting for 70.6%.
Among 907 scenic spots which have reduced prices, the number of the attractions with the decreasing amplitude of more than 20% is 491, accounting for 54.3% and the number of the attractions with the decreasing amplitude of more than 30% is 214, accounting for 23.6%.
Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi, Shaanxi and other provinces have a relatively large number of price reduction scenic spots, of which the number of price reduction scenic spots in Yunnan is more than 100, with an overall decreasing amplitude of more than 30%.
The governments of Anhui, Chongqing and other six provinces (districts or cities) have all reduced prices for 5A scenic spots.
The prices have been reduced in the scenic spots with high social attention in Yunnan Stone Forest, the Dali Three Pagodas, the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, the Lijiang River in Guilin, Guangxi, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, Terracotta Army in Shaanxi, Mount Sanqingshan in Jiangxi and Kanas in Xinjiang.
The ticket prices of key state-owned scenic spots are gradual returning to the reasonable range, which is conducive to promoting the tourism industry to accelerate the transformation and upgrading from ticket economy to industrial economy, from minority tourism to mass tourism and from scenic spot tourism to all-for-one tourism, as well as conducive to forming a virtuous circle of optimization of the supply structure of tourism industry and steady expansion of the demand for tourism consumption, and promoting the sustainable and healthy development of scenic spots and tourism industry.
The National Development and Reform Commission also emphasizes that various regions should strengthen the regulation of price order in scenic spots, guide scenic spots to improve their services, and ensure to reduce prices without reducing quality.
Moreover, for the problems that the decreasing amplitude of ticket prices in some scenic spots is too small and so-called reduction but no practical reduction recently reported by the media, the National Development and Reform Commission has made a special inspection to require various regions to seriously solve the problems, timely respond to the social concerns, and effectively implement price reductions.

National wide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities experts walk into test fields, listen to the situation presentation from CAE Yu Shuxun academician team representative.
China News Service, Xinjiang, Xayar, September 30 (Geng Dandan, Wang Xiaojun) - Located in the Xayar County of Xinjiang, the cotton planted in film-free cotton planting test base has a breathtaking growth. Compared with the film cotton next to it, it is not inferior in any respect. A cluster of snow-white cotton competes "blooming" and is full of branches.
From September 27 to 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Xayar County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the film-free cotton technology system with "Chinese Cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body has initially achieved the goal of film-free planting in cotton fields, reducing the pollution of the Xinjiang cotton field film residue to the ecological environment and raw cotton. And film-free cotton integrated technology’s research and demonstration have achieved significant progresses.
Academician Yu Shuxun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the national modern agricultural industrial technology system’s cotton system, introduced the growth of film-free cotton for Zhou Guomo, secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang A&F University.
"The comprehensive technology of the film-free cotton developed by us can completely realize the cotton planting without the film, and can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting. "
Yu Shuxun described, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is China’s most important cotton-producing region. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the national cotton area.
Since the introduction of mulching film in China in 1982, the filmed area of various types of crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of mulching film is about 30 million tons.
Among them, cotton mulching film coverage rate reached 100%, and cotton field mulching film accounted for about 60% of Xinjiang film use.
Use film-free cotton for production measurement, and the cotton output can be fully realized from 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
With the increasing amount of mulching film input in Xinjiang, the residual film recovery rate is low, the residual film volume in the soil is gradually increased, and the soil structure damages and other problems caused by residual film seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great influence on the quality of cotton fiber.
Currently, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang mechanized harvesting area is about 14 million mu.
In the process of cotton mechanized harvesting, a large amount of broken film on earth surface and the cotton plant are picked up. The broken film doped in the raw cotton is difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton, and can not be completely removed in the subsequent textile processing process, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Xayar County, Xinjiang.
In order to solve the cotton mulching film pollution, simplify the cotton planting technology and improve the cotton field efficiency, Yu Shuxun led his team to use 8 years to implement the "Chinese Cotton 619" film-free cotton technology planting, adding "advantages" to Xinjiang’s agricultural green development.
Yu Shuxun introduced, with the new idea of innovative breeding, they cultivate a new line of extra early ripening, saline-alkaline tolerance, low temperature resistant, and high yield upland cotton "Chinese Cotton 619".
" ‘Chinese Cotton 619’ has achieved a series of supporting measures such as film-free seeding machinery, improved seeding depth, shallow buried in drip irrigation zone, suitable seeding density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation under the condition of film-free cultivation in southern Xinjiang. "
At present, Aksu, Korla, Alear and other places have established a demonstration base for film-free cotton, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Film-free cotton planting has achieved high yield, cost savings, environmental protection and improved overall benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Third Division of the Agricultural Science Research Institute of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation techniques, the production of film-free cottonseed cotton can fully achieve 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, and may even be higher.
"The promotion of film-free cotton cultivation technology has great prospects. "
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, the film-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap between the current economic benefits and the cultivation of mulching film.
"The support of cotton purchasing price will be conducive to future promotion. "
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of the film-free cotton, making the industry of film-free cotton larger and stronger, and completely solving the problem of soil pollution caused by the film.

Wang Yi, the Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister made a speech at the Council of Foreign Relations on Friday, and said that currently, the China-U.S. relation came to a crossroad again. If both sides can actively treat each other with tolerance, expand and deepen the positive cooperation, and properly control differences and contradictions, they can open up a better prospect.
"The China-U.S. relation is our common asset which needs us to care about together. "
He said that it was expected that people of insight from all sectors of both countries took practical actions to maintain the healthy and stable development of the China-U.S. relation and jointly drove the China-U.S. relation to move forward in the right direction.
Wang Yi also emphasized again that China was certain to take a development road different from that of the traditional great powers.
This road with Chinese characteristics determined that China would not or can not repeat the mistake of a strong country becoming a hegemon, and determined that China would not become another United States, or challenge the United States, or even replace the United States.
Wang Yi made a speech with the topic of "Opportunity or challenge, partner or opponent" and said that currently, the profound crux of the problem is that some American friends believed that China would also make a mistake of a strong country becoming a hegemon, and even challenge and replace the leadership of the United States in the world.
"This is obviously a major strategic misjudgment. "
He said that this self-imagined suspicion was spreading, and had amplified the existing contradictions, giving rise to new doubts, and making it more difficult for China and the United States to solve specific problems and encounter more resistance.
Wang Yi pointed out that the road China was walking on was a road for peaceful development.
Chinese people have never had a gene for expansion.
It was believed that all countries can live in harmony, and make exchanges and mutual learning.
Regardless of past, present or future, China would never copy foreign models, or require other countries to copy China's practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with Kissinger, the former U.S. Secretary of State, in New York, he said that China-U.S. cooperation would be win-win and the confrontation would be necessarily lose-lose.
The Chinese side was always committed to developing the long-term, healthy and stable China-U.S. relation and achieving no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.

The rescuers in Palu said they heard cries for help from a inside buried hotel, but they could do nothing because they didn't have heavy-duty machines to remove the rubbles. Some rescuers had to save people with their bare hands.
Kalla, the Vice President of Indonesia, said that the electricity and communication in some places were cut off, so the information was blocked. The number of deaths in this earthquake and tsunami might finally rise up to several thousands.

"Where can we take a taxi?
We'd like to go to the Golden Bauhinia Square to watch the National Day flag-raising ceremony! "
In the morning of October 1, Mr and Mrs Song, who specially flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen and transferred to the first train of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link for National Day, accepted an interview of a reporter from China News at the West Kowloon station in Hong Kong and inquired such information.
In the morning of October 1, in order to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong SAR Government held a grand flag-raising ceremony at the Golden Bauhinia Square.
According to the statistics of the Immigration Control Point, as of September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the West Kowloon station of the high-speed railway have exceeded 300,000.
At the very time of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the West Kowloon boundary checkpoint predicts a peak of visitors to Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
The reporter saw at the arrival lobby around 7:00 a.m. on October 1 that many mainland tourists took advantage of the National Day Golden Week, to take the high-speed rail and visit Hong Kong.
Mrs Song with light-footedness told the reporter that the National Day holiday was a rare long holiday in a year. It has always been her wish to come to the Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong to watch the flag-raising ceremony. She felt very happy and excited to be able to accomplish this will on National Day.
But currently, the flights between Ningxia and Hong Kong are inconvenient. Thanks to the opening of the high-speed railway for the Hong Kong segment. Mr Song checked the train schedule and found that the first train could arrive at 7:03 a.m., and it was perfect timing for taking urban transportation means to the Golden Bauhinia Square.
He told the reporters, "the high-speed railway is very convenient, fast and on time! "
The 70 daily one-hour short-haul trains running between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North, Futian and West Kowloon greatly facilitated the residents in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to visit Hong Kong.
After arriving in Hong Kong, Mr Liu, who lived in Shenzhen, was preparing to join his Hong Kong friends at the top of a hill in Central.
Mr Liu said, "both the mainland and Hong Kong have holidays on National Day. We intend to challenge ourselves and see if we can complete walking the 50-kilometer Hong Kong Trail! "
He explained that they would not dare to make such a long trek without the convenience and sufficient time brought about by the high-speed railway.
Mrs Yang, who came from Dongguan, took her 10-year-old son to come to Hong Kong to participate in the piano competition by taking the high-speed railway. She proudly told the reporter that her son had been studying piano for three years, and it was very meaningful to spend the National Day in this way.
She had previously come to Hong Kong by bus, but it was time-consuming and laborious. She was worried about affecting her son's condition. This time she came from Shenzhen by high-speed railway. The customs clearance was convenient and the time was reduced by half. She was more impressed by the trip in Hong Kong segment. She told the reporter, "it seems like taking the subway, which is very fast. I am not able to do take photos before arriving! "
At 6:44 a.m. on September 23, the G5711 "Harmony" high-speed train departed from Shenzhen North Railway Station and sped all the way. A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong segment of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link. This was the first formally operated high-speed train in the Hong Kong segment.
The Hong Kong segment of the high-speed railway, which integrates the national 25,000-kilometer high-speed rail network and reaches 38 long-distance stations throughout the country, also welcomes mainland tourists from different provinces far apart from each other.
Mr Gao, who took advantage of minor vacation to visit relatives in Hong Kong from Changsha, told the reporter that previously, the high-speed railway could only travel to Shenzhen North, and he needed to take the subway to pass through Hong Kong, and then take urban transportation means. It was troublesome and time-consuming to make transfers. Now, he can travel directly to the center of Kowloon and have lunch which was made by his children when getting home. He felt very happy.
He said that the "one port and two immigration inspection" customs clearance procedure were very convenient beyond imagination, and "passing both customs within 10 minutes. "
The West Kowloon Station, which is close to the Airport Express and connects land and air traffic, has also become the preferred destination for many transit passengers.
Miss Wu, from Fujian Province, prepared to spend the Golden Week with her friends traveling from Hong Kong to Philippines. Pushing her luggage out of the gate on time in West Kowloon, she told the reporter without hesitation, "I was afraid of not catching up with the plane, but I didn't think it would be so fast and that was more than enough! "
According to the subsidiary arrangement of the trade agreement published on Monday, the new U.S. -Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain the President Trump's ability to implement the threat to impose a 25% tariff on imported cars, while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickup trucks and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico from paying tariffs.
If Trump imposes a so-called "Chapter 232" tariff on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada will have a tax-exempt quota of 2.6 million passenger cars exported to the United States each year.
According to the subsidiary arrangement, the pickup trucks manufactured in both countries will be fully exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will receive a tax exemption quota of $108 billion each year for auto parts, and Canada will receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
These two quotas are far higher than the current production levels of the two countries, and provide their exports with growth space.
Report of Reuters on September 28 in Washington/Mexico: Mexico said on Friday that after days of debates, the U.S. President Trump's government and Canada were making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would maintain the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite lack of details, the obvious progress mentioned above is enough to prompt the Mexican and American governments to abruptly stop publishing the text of the two-party trade agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the Mexican president-elect, told the reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said he would continue to urge these three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Ildefonso Guajardo, the Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs, said the time for submitting the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement to the legislation departments of Mexico and the United States had been delayed because the Canadian and American governments tried to reach an agreement "very seriously".
Guajardo said, "In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we will get a text of a tripartite agreement or have to publish the text of the two-party agreement. "
Guajardo said that the officials at the same level in the U.S. and Canada had "special requests" to postpone to publish the text.
The spokesman of the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the bilateral trade agreement between the United States and Mexico and the negotiations between the United States and Canada.
Officials of the Prime Minister's Office and the Office of Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
According to foreign media reports, it was hard for people to find anything unusual in two little lions playing in a conservation center located in the suburb in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, but they were absolutely unique.
University of Pretoria announced: "They are the first lions in the history, which are born by artificial insemination -- the first pair of lions in the world. "
The scientists of the university were committing themselves to studying the reproductive system of female African lions.
Ganswindt, the director of Mammal Institute of University of Pretoria, said that these two little lions born on August 25 were a female lion and a male lion. They were pretty healthy and quite normal.
After the intensive tests in 18 months, his team finally made this breakthrough.
Ganswindt said in a media interview: "We collected the sperms from a healthy male lion. "
Next, the researchers waited for the hormones in the female lion to reach a proper level so as to conduct the artificial insemination in it.
Ganswindt said: "Fortunately, the result turned out to be successful. "
He said that the researchers "tried many times, but to their surprise, it didn't take much effort".
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthrough could be verified repeatedly, and the scientists hoped to use this technology to save the endangered big cats.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature indicated that the lion had already become extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of survival wild lions had declined sharply by 43% in the past 20 years with only about 20,000 wild lions left.
The African lion was listed as vulnerable by this organization.
Ganswindt said: "This animal will be in danger of extinction if we do nothing for them. "
He said that with this kind of new technology, it's not necessary for the lions to be fed. The sperms could be injected into the bodies of female lions, just like the approach adopting on the elephants in captivity in North America and Europe.
The exports of South Korea fell the most in more than two years in September, but analysts put the blame of the decline on fewer working days and said that although the trade tension between China and the United States rose, the global demand for South Korean goods remained strong.
Indeed, the average daily exports of South Korea increased last month.
Moreover, the initial value data released earlier showed that the exports in first weeks of September during the long vacation had a double-digit increase.
The year-on-year drop of South Korean exports in September was the largest since July 2016, which was more than the decrease of 5.7% estimated by 11 analysts of Reuters surveys.
The initial value released on Monday showed that the amount of exports in September was $50.6 billion, lower than $51.2 billion in August.
Although the China-US trade disputes with intensifying concerns might cause other neighboring countries of China which depended on exports to suffer, Korean exports to China in September increased by 7.8%, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
Since the sales of oil products declined, Korean exports to America decreased by 11.8%.
Although the market worried that the so-called "supercycle" of chips might reach the peak, the overseas sales of Korean memory chips and oil products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively.
"However, the influence of trade conflicts cannot be avoided, because Korean exports considerably depend on American and Chinese markets. "
The imports decreased by 2.1% to $40.8 billion, inferior to the increase of 3.1% estimated by the Reuters survey.
The initial value of trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, higher than $6.9 billion in August.
The Department of Industry said that thanks to America and the EU countries, the global manufacturing would maintain buoyant, which was a favorable factor for Korean exports.
The statement pointed out, "the increasing export price caused by the rise of the oil price will be beneficial to the exports in the second half of this year. "
"However, the trade conflict between the United States and China continues and the market fluctuation after rising U.S. interest rates intensifies, which are both negative pressure on exports. "
The average exports of each working day in September increased to $2.6 billion, while the amount in August was $2.1 billion.
The Mid-Autumn Festival in South Korea this year was from September 24-26 so that there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
The Korean exports from January to September increased by 4.7% compared with that of the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, activities of Korean manufacturing rose again in September which was supported by domestic orders, since Chinese and Japanese orders declined, which would probably cast a shadow over export prospects.
North Korean media criticized the United States for not easing the sanctions on North Korea.
North Korea's "Rodong Shinmun" published a signatured review article on September 30 to criticize the United States for not easing the sanctions on North Korea while seeking to have a dialogue with North Korea. The article said that it was a "self-contradictory" action.
The article said that Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, indicated on September 14 that "the key to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was to impose the sanctions on North Korea" to emphasize that the United States would keep its position on implementing the UN resolution to impose sanctions.
In the North Korea-US Joint Statement of Singapore, the two sides promised to build a new North Korea-US relation, which complied with the two peoples' wishes of looking forward to peace and prosperity.
On one side, the United States increased the intensity of sanctions, but on the other side, it asked for the dialogue. Undoubtedly, its actions were self-contradictory.
According to the article, if it wanted to build a new North Korea-US relation, establish a permanently consolidated system of peace in the Korean Peninsula, and achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it would put building trust in the first place, start from what can be done, and solve the problems by stages.
The article also said that the United States should understand that it wouldn't work to impose sanctions on North Korea.
The article said that even the "Severodvinsk" preceded the "Kazan" was admired by the U.S. military.

Ignore the Threat of America!
EU may Reach Crude Oil Purchase Agreement with Iran
The US government announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urge other countries to reduce imports of Iran oil.
However, the American allies did not seem to take the advice.
According to the US "New York Times", on 29th, during the interview, Zarif, Foreign Minister of Iran, revealed that although the United States threatened to sanction any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is approaching to reach an agreement on the sale of crude oil with EU.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, which is to replace the dollar transaction in the form of barter or domestic currency.
The purpose of this approach is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from impeding financial transfers.
Meanwhile, although the EU is working on facilitating the agreement, some French and British officials are also worried that if the agreement is concluded, it will be the most overt confrontation between the EU and the United States against the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
The US media said that in the one hour interview , Zarif’s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement can "strip" the traditional American allies and effectively break the US’s attempts to cut Iran’s income.
"This can guarantee that we can sell oil and obtain benefits", Zarif believed. According to the agreement reached in 2015, each country has the legal rights to make trade contacts with Iran.
The head of Union for Foreign Affairs Policy, Federica Mogherini, also said recently that "no sovereign state or organization can accept other people to decide who they can trade with. "
However, she also predicted that before the US government carried out the next step of sanctions in November, US leaders could adopt a series of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that have commercial intercourses with Tehran.
In May of this year, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement had deficiencies, saying that the agreement could not permanently prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US then threatened to ban companies that buy Iran oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat forced some companies to leave Tehran and made the Iranian currency dropped sharply.
Companies such as Airbus S.A.S. and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iran.
British and French officials said, the US government may "take the lead".
Unsurprisingly, according to a recent report by the Turkish media, the US sanctions did not seem to have a major impact on Iran’s oil exports.
Recently, Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh disclosed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iran oil.
Both Zarif and Iran President Rouhani believed that the purpose of a series of US actions is to "seduce" Iran’s breach of the agreement.
Zarif also regarded the US serial blast as not worthy of consideration. When asked if the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed. "It is a regime change strategy, and this is the true purpose of the US. "

Relevant notices published on the website of the Ministry of Finance said that the temporary non-imposition of withholding income tax from foreign investors should meet several conditions at the same time, including direct investment of foreign investors with profit-sharing, and equity investments of foreign investors, such as capital increase, greenfield investment and equity acquisition with profit-sharing, but excluding new, turning point increase and acquisition of shares of listed companies (except for eligible strategic investments).

The reporter learned from the National Health Commission that the prevalence of malnutrition in our children and adolescents had reduced but the prevalence of overweight-obesity had significantly increased comparing to decades ago.
The expert pointed out that the most important concept to maintain a healthy weight was the "preventive treatment of disease". The scientific fitness and rational diet should be vigorously promoted.
According to the "Core Information on Health Education of Chinese Adolescents and Interpretation (2018 version)" released by the National Health Commission recently, the key to maintain a healthy weight was the rational diet and scientific movement.
The overweight, obesity and blind weight reduction were harmful to health.
The health hazard behind the "chubby children" couldn't be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, the head of National Institute for Nutrition and Health of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight-obesity could harm the adolescents' normal growth and development, have a negative impact on their mentality, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even cause hypertension, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in children.
And the adolescents' overweight-obesity might continue into adulthood, which would increase the adolescents' risk of having chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes in their adulthood.
Ding Gangqiang said that the overweight rate was 9.6% and the obesity rate was 6.4% among Chinese children and adolescents of 6-17 years old according to the Nutrition and Health Status Inspection of Chinese Residents in 2010-2012. The sum of these two rates was 16%.
Meanwhile, the characteristics of overweight-obesity among children and adolescents were that the overweight-obesity rate was higher in boys than in girls, and it was higher in cities than in villages. The overweight-obesity rate had significantly increased in recent decades.
How would the adolescents deal with the overweight-obesity?
Zhang Li, the deputy director of Science Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of General Administration of Sport of China, indicated that the primary causes of adolescent obesity at present were excessive caloric intake and inadequate physical activity.
For this kind of simple obesity, we should lay emphasis on scientific movement and reasonable diet control.
Zhang Li pointed out that the most important concept to maintain a healthy weight was the "preventive treatment of disease", and an integral part of it was to conduct the all-round science popularization education of schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and increase the adolescents' self-protection awareness.
The adolescents should take the periodic physical examination to monitor the growth and development index, such as height and weight, so that the problems of overweight and obesity could be discovered early and determined scientifically to take intervention measures in time.
For those adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang advised that starvation therapy or semi-starvation therapy should be avoided to control and lose weight in addition to the active and scientific arrangement of diet and movement since the adolescents are in a special physiological stage. They should not take drugs blindly to lose weight.

China News Service, Yichang, October 1 (reported by Guo Xiaoying and Liu Min) -- The newly revised "Three Gorges-Gezhouba Hydro Project Navigation Scheduling Regulation" (hereinafter referred to as "Scheduling Regulation") was officially enforced starting from October 1. After two years of navigation test, the Three Gorges ship lift was officially scheduled together with the navigation lock in a unified way.
On the first day of enforcing the new regulations, the navigation in Three Gorges-Gezhouba waters was in good order.
Three Gorges Navigation Authority released the first plan of security check at 21:00 on September 30, and carried out the security check on 160 ships, with 124 ships passing the security check.
The navigation authority arranged the first locking plan after the enforcement of new regulations at 14:00 on October, 1.
After the enforcement of new regulations, the plan of security check would be released once every day at 9:00 and 21:00, and the plan of passing dam would be released once every day at 14:00 and 20:00, so that the ships could flexibly arrange the plan of passing dam.
The "Classification Control" scheduling principle of ship passing dam was added in the "Scheduling Regulation". The priority of ship passing dam would be determined according to the functional localization of navigation lock and ship lift respectively. The short-term passenger ship passing dam would be adjusted to be in the same priority as the demonstration ship and integrity ship.
This is also the official scheduling of ship lift and navigation lock after the two-year navigation test of ship lift.
It was also the first time for big length-width demonstration ship and new energy driven ship of Chuanjiang River and Three Gorges Reservoir Region to be ranked in the priority.
At the same time, the "navigation scheduling management waters" were adjusted from the 180-kilometer waters close to dam to the 541.8-kilometer waters from Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to Shishou Yangtze River Bridge in the "Scheduling Regulation". And the "core waters", "water close to dam", "control waters" and "scheduling waters" were divided.
This action would help the ship choose the proper waters to wait for crossing the lock, avoiding excessive ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region.
The "Scheduling Regulation" also put forward the measures of integrity constraint for the rule-breaking ships according to the current characteristics of ship passing dam and waiting for crossing lock, such as canceling the declaration and delaying the time of passing dam for 24 hours.
After water storing of the Three Gorges, the navigation condition of the reservoir area was improved, accelerating the rapid development of shipping in Yangtze River.
According to data, the annual cargo throughput of Three Gorges ship lock and Gezhouba ship lock was increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 0.138 billion tons and 0.14 billion tons in 2017 respectively.
During the two-year navigation test of ship lift, 5767 ships and 0.1622 million people have passed, and the volume of goods transported was 1.7128 million tons.
Chen Dongyuan, the deputy director of Three Gorges Navigation Authority, said that the "Scheduling Regulation" played an active role in promoting the management of crossing lock in an honest way, relieving the pressure of ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region, and improving the navigation capacity.

Signed and approved by Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council printed and distributed the "Decision of the State Council on Further Reducing the Categories in the Catalogue of Industrial Products Subject to Production License Administration and Simplifying the Approval Procedures".
The "Decision" proposed to further reduce the categories in the catalogue of industrial products subject to production license administration, cancel the production license administration for 14 industrial products, and delegate the administration authority for production licenses of 4 types of industrial products to the quality and technical supervision departments of provincial people’s governments.
After this reform, the products that implement the industrial product production licenses administration will be reduced from last year’s 38 categories to the current 24 categories.
The "Decision" clearly simplifies the approval process for products in the catalogue.
First, the pre-certification product inspection organized by the issuing authority is changed to the product inspection conformity report issued by the qualified inspection and testing institution when the enterprise applies.
Second, in addition to dangerous chemicals, the products that have been licensed by the quality and technical supervision department (market supervision and management department) of the provincial people’s government shall be subject to post-site inspection. After the enterprise submits the application and product inspection conformity report and makes a commitment to ensure product quality and safety, the production license can be obtained after passing the formal examination, and then the on-site examination is accepted within the specified time.
Third, for enterprises produce different types of products in the production and operation catalogue, in accordance with the principle of "one enterprise, one license", when apply for a new license or apply for a license renewal, a license should be issued and examined.
The "Decision" requires that all regions and relevant departments should solidly promote the reduction of catalogue and simplify the examination and approval procedures.
Increase the commitment publicity of enterprises and post-site inspection work, strengthen credit supervision and restraint means, implement the responsibility of the main body of the enterprise, and revoke the production license for false promises and non-compliance.
For the products that cancel the production licenses administration for industrial products, it is necessary to strengthen the post supervision, and the products related to public health and safety, environmental protection, etc. can be converted into compulsory certification, list positive lists and publicize to the public, unify the certification standards and reasonably reduce and merge the certification and testing items, and the compulsory certification fees in principle should be borne by the financial institutions at all levels.

Report of Reuters on November 5 in Nagoya: Haruhiko Kuroda, the president of the Bank of Japan said on Monday that the bank realized that the long-term implementation of ultra-easing monetary policy could squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and destabilize the banking system of Japan.
However, he said that due to the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needed to maintain its large-scale incentive plans and pay close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the sustained monetary easing policy, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Haruhiko Kuroda said in a speech to the business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions were more active in taking risks to compensate for the effect of low interest rates on shrinking profit margins over the years, the banking system could be unstable in the event of serious negative impacts.
"Although these risks are not too big at present, the Bank of Japan will closely monitor the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures," he said.
The minutes released by the Bank of Japan earlier on Monday showed that the policy committee of the Bank of Japan discussed the problem of rising costs of the long-term easing policy at the interest rate meeting in September.
The minutes showed that a member of the board said that if the economy continued to expand, "the Bank of Japan will have more flexibility in the aspect of policy in the future. "
The minutes showed that another member of the board said that due to the limits of policy duration, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the incentive policy.
Haruhiko Kuroda said that the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks brought by the easing policy, and take into account the uncertainties centered on Japan's economic prospects, as China-U.S. trade frictions and rising protectionism might affect the global demand.
"The impact of such problems on Japan's economy is temporarily limited," Haruhiko Kuroda said.
"But if the problem persists, the impact on Japan's economy may increase," he added.
"It is necessary to sustain the strong monetary easing policy and consider both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner," Haruhiko Kuroda said.
Although the disadvantages of radical incentive plans were increasing, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, the low inflation forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan maintained the monetary policy last month; Haruhiko Kuroda ruled out the possibility of recent interest rate increase about the risks brought by the conflict of the global trade war.
On June 1, 2018, in Cardiff, the United States, the corporate identity on Tesla electric cars.
According to a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors and its CEO, Musk, had agreed to separately pay $20 million fines to the financial regulators, and Musk would resign as President of the company, but still held the post of CEO.
This settlement agreement would end two months of unrest in Tesla.
This settlement agreement on securities fraud charge released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Saturday would make investors relieved.
Investors were originally worried that the protracted legal battle would only further hit the electric car company, which was still losing money.
SEC prosecuted Musk for frauds on Thursday, saying that his tweet on August 7 misled the investors.
The tweet said that he was considering to privatize Tesla with $420 per share and had obtained financing.
SEC said that these tweets actually had no evidences and the volatility in market triggered by them had hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts said that this agreement could strengthen Tesla, which had been hit hard by Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, the leader of assets management company of Boston Common, said that this settlement agreement should let Musk receive more monitoring, but had not taken any "destructive" measures to throw him out of Tesla.
This assets management company held shares of Panasonic, the battery manufacturer of Tesla.
According to this proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint a independent president, two independent directors and a board committee to set out controls aiming at Musk’s external communications.
"This matter was resolved promptly according to the agreed conditions, which met the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The charge on Thursday caused the market value of Tesla evaporate about $7 billion. The market value of this company was $45.2 billion, lower than $47.5 billion of General Motors.
SEC withdrew the requirement for throwing Musk out of the head position of the company.
Many investors said that this punishment would be catastrophic.
"I think it is the best possible result for all relevant staff," Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners said. Feinseth gave a "neutral" evaluation to Tesla and said that the punishment of SEC was a "lighter punishment" to Musk.
"The fact that he still holds the position of CEO is very important to Tesla. "
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the charge of SEC in the settlement agreement, or immediately replied to the request for commenting.
The settlement agreement still needed to get approval of the court.
Beijing Morning Post (reported by Wang Ping) -- The reporter of Beijing Morning Post learned from Beijing Construction Engineering Group a few days ago that the multi-colored ETFE jigsaw membrane structure would be adopted in the Performing Arts Plaza project of the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 Beijing, which was one of the core building groups in the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 Beijing park. The 5440-meter membrane structure would show 6 colors, including dark red, dark green, orange, blue, red, and green, and it would appear in the shape of "a butterfly flying up high" under the tension created by steel strand draglines.
According to the introduction made by Liu Changbao, the project leader of Beijing No. 5 Construction Engineering Group, the building area of the Performing Arts Plaza project was 4500 square meters, and the total amount of installed steal was 1182 tons. The steel roof was supported by the cantilever steel truss with a 26-beam umbrella arrangement. It would appear in the shape of "a butterfly flying up high" under the tension created by steel strand draglines.
"Taking a bird's-eye view of the Performing Arts Plaza, the colorful roof seems like a butterfly dancing among the flowers. And the bright colors will not fade even weathered rain and snow over time".
The single-colored ETFE membrane structure has been widely applied in the Bird's Nest, the Water Cube, and other projects, but this is the first time to use the multi-colored ETFE jigsaw membrane structure across the country.
The reported learned that every inch of the membrane structure was very "precious" since there were only a few suppliers capable of producing the multi-colored membrane structure around the world.
Liu Changbao said that the dragline head structure with "double ears" would also be adopted innovatively to aviod the problems of overlapping or "fighting" in the position of dragline head. A special fixed widget would be used to ensure the "fighted" dragline heads are packed in the correct position.
The construction of the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 Beijing park is in progress at present.
The project of the International Hall has completed all hoisting construction works of "flower umbrella".
According to the plan, the project will be ready for arranging the exhibitions at the end of October.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private sector symposium, injecting a firm confidence into the broader stage of the private economy.
General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that "letting entrepreneurs unload their mental loads and march with light packs", which has a strong resonance among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the magnificent course of the 40 years of reform and opening up, there are thousands of entrepreneurs entrepreneurship and innovation stories, the growth and expansion of entrepreneurs-group constantly push the Chinese economy to sail far.
For some time, some people in the society have published some remarks that negate and doubt the private economy.
The so-called "private economic departure theory" and "new public-private partnership theory" and other misconceptions have caused some entrepreneurs’ doubts and concerns.
Recently, some private enterprise have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, the changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of the demand structure has brought about the pressure of transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effects are superimposed in the same direction, or the working methods are simple, resulting in some policies with good original intentions have the opposite effect, etc.
All kinds of factors are intertwined, the private economy is facing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
Under this context, it is particularly profound and practical to correct the cognition errors, let the entrepreneurs’ unload the mental load, let them develop wholeheartedly, make the government promote development devotedly and concern market confidence and development expectations.
This symposium once again emphasized the important assertion of the "Three no-changes": "There is no change in the role and function of non-public sector in our economic and social development"!
In recent years, from deepening the promotion of streamline administration and delegate more power to lower-level governments, establishing a power list system, and creating a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a market environment of fair competition and shaping the atmosphere of respecting entrepreneurs in the whole society, the Party Central Committee has attached unprecedented emphasis on entrepreneurs and institutional guarantees.
The symposium clearly stated the six aspects’ policy measures to vigorously support the development and expansion of private enterprises, and launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated to the "march with light packs" of private enterprises.
These actions have greatly encouraged the entrepreneurial community and have given more expectations to the community.
The fog has been set aside, and the policy has been set. And the key aspect lies in implementation.
We must continue to create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties in development, and help achieve China’s economic transformation and upgrading; let entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal operations, and feel respected in social life, stimulate innovation and create potential.
The Chinese economy has stepped into a process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to display their ambitions and providing more spaces and stages for entrepreneurs to exert their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening reforms and removing obstacles, the private economy will greet better development prospects and opportunities and move toward a broader stage.

Report on November 5 in Inner Mongolia of China News (reported by Li Aiping): the Hohhot Customs said on November 5 that 46 types of local import and export supervision licenses were verified online from that day, except for confidentiality requirements and other special circumstances.
The enterprises in Inner Mongolia can declare relevant documents to the Customs in paperless way, so as to avoid the problems of rushing around on site, paper application, repeated submission, etc.
It was known that the preparation time of documents referred to the preparation time of various types of documents required for import and export before declaration, which was a major factor that affected the overall clearance time. In order to compress the clearance time and reduce the clearance costs, the documents must be reduced.
Previously, there were 86 types of supervision documents in the import and export process which required customs examination, involving 19 departments.
It was reported that according to the principle of "to cancel what can be canceled, to merge what can be merged and to withdraw what can be withdrawn from port inspection" this time and relying on the international trade "single window" platform, the Customs and other 16 license-issuing authority systems made docking and data interconnection, to achieve more data flows and less enterprise errands.
The customs said that in the past, enterprises had to go back and forth to the onsite office hall of the relevant authorities to submit paper applications. The process was long and it was impossible to track the verification status in real time.
Now the enterprise users can directly log into the "single window" portal to apply online.
Upon approval of the license-issuing authority, the electronic data of the certificate would be transmitted to the Customs, and automatic comparison and intelligent examination of the Customs declaration data would be done in the Customs clearance process. All the examination results would be sent back to the enterprise through the "single window", which can make the whole process of declaration, examination, customs clearance and feedback of supervision documents complete online.
Exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China surged 20 times in four years, which may be related to the increase of empty-nest youth - China News
Exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China surged 20 times in four years; analysis: it is related to the increase of empty-nest youth
According to the report on Day 5 of Yonhap, last year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China exceeded 100,000 US dollars, which surged 20 times compared with that of four years ago, in 2013.
The analysis suggests that this growth is related to the hot sales of convenience food driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the increasing attention of young people on nutritious meals.
This data is published by the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corp (aT) on Day 5.
Last year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China was 100,339 US dollars and the weight was 21,859 kg, which surged by 2094% and 3668.8 % respectively compared with that in 2013.
The analysis suggests that the increasing sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup in China are related to the hot sales of convenience food driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the increasing attention of young people on nutritious meals.
By the end of this year, the number of one-person households in China have exceeded 200 million, and it is expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020. Local food enterprises are also aiming at the “eating-alone people" and launching various convenience food.
Moreover, the analysis also indicates that bird flu is the biggest factor which prevents ginseng chicken soup from taking root in the Chinese mainland market.
aT says that bird flu outbroke in South Korea from November 2016 to April of last year. Relevant departments comprehensively ban the export of ginseng chicken soup to China which leads to sharp reduction of export sales.
In 2016, the export sales of ginseng chicken soup in China was 840,000 US dollars. Due to bird flu, the export sales of last year plummeted to 100,000 US dollars.

U.S. warships approached the South China Sea islands and reefs again
U.S. officials revealed on Sunday (September 30, 2018) that the United States Navy destroyer, USS Decatur, cruised into the waters near the South China Sea islands over which Beijing had sovereignty on the eve of Chinese National Day Holiday.

The details of the sanctions would be announced by the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in the 1330GMT media session.
The United States said that it would temporarily allow eight importing places to continue purchasing Iranian oil, including major Iranian oil buyers such as China, India, South Korea, Japan and Turkey, to ensure that crude oil prices remained stable.

A gateway flag-raising ceremony is held in Hekou port on China-Vietnam boarder to celebrate the National Day.
"I didn't expect to see such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony on the frontier. It is more amazing to watch the flag-raising here than in the mainland. "
In the morning of October 1, Mr Zhang, who came from Sichuan to visit Hekou port in Yunnan on China-Vietnam boarder, watched the gateway flag-raising ceremony together with more than 500 army officers and soldiers, local people, and Chinese and foreign tourists to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Hekou port is the biggest port on China-Vietnam boarder in Yunnan. It is located in Hekou county in Honghe Prefecture in Yunnan Province with just a river away from Lao Cai City in Vietnam. It is a first-class national port.
With the continuous enhancement of "One Belt and One Road" construction in China, as one of the most convenient passage connecting China and Southeast Asia, Hekou port has a steady growth of departure and entry flow.
At 7:30 in the early morning of the same day, a ray of sunshine just showed in the sky. The local people and Chinese and foreign tourists had gathered in the restricted areas in Hekou port very early to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 7:45, the flag-raising ceremony started on time. The members of gateway honor guard of Hekou Frontier Inspection Station were in high spirits and walked with vigorous steps escorting the national flag to the flag tower.
After the flag-raising command made by the commander, the flag raiser waved his arm hard to draw an arc. The bright five-star red flag stretched out like an "eagle stretching its wings", and rose slowly with the melody of the majestic and impassioned national anthem.
"It not only shows China's image, but also inspires the patriotism among people of all nationalities in border areas to held a flag-raising ceremony on every New Year's day, Spring Festival, National Day, and other time nodes of great significance. "
A member of the honor guard taking part in this flag-raising ceremony said.
It is reported that the gateway honor guard taking charge of flag-raising ceremony in Hekou port is made up of more than 40 officials and soldiers coming from various positions of Hekou Frontier Inspection Station. From a 3-member flag-raising team to a large-scale honor guard, it has developed in more than 60 years. Since its establishment, it has performed more than 70 national-level tasks in foreign affairs as the honor guard.
The newly revised Individual Income Tax Law will adjust the criterion for resident taxpayers of China’s Individual Income Tax Law from one year to 183 days.
On 30th, the relevant principals from the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China and State Administration of Taxation said that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
The principals expressed that the current effective Individual Income Tax Law’s enforcement regulations have special preferential provisions for taxation issues for foreigners. For individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for more than one year and less than five years and earn incomes from outside China, their part of the payment by domestic units or individuals is subject to individual income tax.
The portion of the overseas payment does not need to pay personal income tax in China.
The Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China, the State Administration of Taxation, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Commerce also issued notices to expand the scope of application of no withholding income tax policy for overseas investors with distribution of profit investment.
For the profit distributed by overseas investors from domestic enterprises in China used for the scope of application of no withholding income tax policy for domestic direct investment, the foreign investment encouraged projects should be extended to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and fields.
During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, the parties released some positive information for the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in related the "irreversible" denuclearisation determination as told by the DPRK and said that US President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The US State Department subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeo will visit the DPRK in October to promote the implementation of the US-DPRK leadership meeting in Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the DPRK and the ROK broke the ice and opened the dialogue, and the DPRK - ROK and the DPRK-US leaders held meetings. The general trend of the easing of the peninsula has been continued, and the dialogue’s principle of solving the peninsula issue has also been adhered to.
First of all, the fact that "the essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue" has not changed. The key to realizing peace on the peninsula is to resolve the reasonable security concerns of all parties in a proper and balance manner, instead of putting pressure on the other side and stressing own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking of "who is first and who is second" is still strong.
At the public meeting of the UN Security Council Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the two points on the peninsula that have not changed.
Pompeo, US Secretary of State, insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, stressed the principle of "responding to action by action". He pointed out: "The weakening trend of sanctions should be in synchronization with the pace taken by North Korea on the road of gradual denuclearization."
Undoubtedly, all parties concerned should continue to implement the North Korea related resolutions of the UN Security Council in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner. However, pressuring is not an end. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are all requirements of the UN Security Council resolutions. The two cannot be neglected, and cannot only choose one
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in the DPRK-ROK and DPRK-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the UN Security Council to consider launching reversible clauses in a timely manner, thereby encouraging North Korea and relevant parties to take a big move toward denuclearization.
Review the past, every development in the denuclearization of the peninsula and in the peace process requires the parties to demonstrate sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the international community’s increasingly high expectations for promoting a political solution to the peninsula issue, all parties concerned should demonstrate political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve problems, and continue to take the opposite direction and advance peninsula denuclearization process and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula to jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.
A message from Ji County People's Government in Linfen City in Shanxi Province on October 1 indicated that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River located in this county would maintain higher levels of water during the National Day holiday, so it didn't meet the requirements to be open to the public.
In order to ensure the safety, the scenic areas will be temporarily closed during the National Day holiday.
Hukou Falls of Yellow River is the second biggest fall in China, and the biggest yellow fall in the world.
The Yellow River flows here at great speed, and the stone walls on both sides are rising steeply. The river mouth becomes narrow like the spout of kettle, forming the situation that "a thousand miles of Yellow River seems like to be collected into a kettle".
The reporter learned that the flood season of yellow river would come in every June to October. Due to high levels of water, the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had been closed one after another since July 12, 2018. Therefore, according to the accumulative calculation, Hukou scenic areas had been closed for nearly a month.
Ni Yufeng, the chief engineer of Hukou Scenic Areas Management Committee, said to the media that it was the longest time for the Yellow River to keep high levels of water during the past 20 years. "It hasn't been closed for such a long time. We closed it for four days in the flood season in 2017. However, it has been closed for nearly a month. "
It was learned that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had originally arranged extra staff and vehicle maintenance in advance in order to be well-prepared for the "National Day" golden week, and even the temporary staff had been hired.
According to the "Notice on Being Well-prepared for the Flood Control in the Yellow River during the National Day Holiday" issued in the "Office Telegram of Yellow River Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters", Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong were required to be well-prepared for the flood control in the Yellow River during the National Day holiday.
Currently, the flow of the main stream of the Yellow River is relatively large. The upstream river flow is maintained at 2000-3000 cubic meters per second, the midstream river flow is maintained at 2500―3500 cubic meters per second, and the downstream river flow is maintained at 3000 cubic meters per second.
The health center and the health station specially provide influenza vaccination services during the National Day Holidays
The health station has ordered 150,000 doses of the 2018-2019 four-strain flu vaccine this year and at this stage, free vaccination is preferentially provided for high-risk people. To facilitate the citizens to vaccinate with flu vaccine during the holiday, all the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau will specially provide vaccination services from 9 am to 1 pm during the National Day Holidays ( October 1 through 2).
In addition to the above-mentioned convenience measures, all the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau have extended their influenza vaccination service time to 8 pm from Monday to Friday. By 4 pm on September 30, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, which was more than that of the same period last year for 3,714 people.
Free vaccination objects include the following Macao residents: people under the age of 6 months to 18 years, people at the age of 50 and above, pregnant women, all patients with chronic diseases (including fat people, namely, the persons whose body mass index (BMI) is 30 or more), staff of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools and middle schools, all the health workers and the Macao residents who work in the casino.
Meanwhile, for the other people who are considered to be necessary to vaccinate by the Health Bureau, including the personnel of the public sectors, the Health Bureau will take the initiative to contact the relevant authorities to obtain the list and then the health centers will arrange them for vaccination.
To facilitate the vaccinees and reduce the waiting time for vaccination, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to Macao middle schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries from October to December to perform collective influenza vaccination to the children, students, teachers and staff; in addition, the Health Bureau will also arrange staff to go to the institutions of the elderly and disabled, public sectors or other institutions with a large number of people to perform collective influenza vaccination.
Students and children who fail to participate in the collective vaccination can take Macao resident identity cards, user cards of the Health Bureau, influenza vaccination cards (if any), student identity cards, employee identity cards or occupational certificates to the vaccination station of the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário or health centers from December 3, 2018.
The Health Bureau reminds residents that people who vaccinated with the 2017-2018 flu vaccine during September 2017 and August 2018 still need to vaccinate with the new seasonal flu vaccine from September 2018, since the flu antigen composition of 2018-2019 flu vaccine in the Northern Hemisphere has been updated , which is targeted at the seasonal influenza in winter of 2018-2019 and summer of 2019 in the Northern Hemisphere.
The peak of influenza in Macao usually occurs from January till March every year, later than that of the temperate regions (such as Northern China and Japan). The Health Bureau urges the elderly, children, pregnant women, fat people and chronic patients who are at high risk of complications after being infected with influenza and people who are in regular contact with high-risk people to get vaccinated as soon as possible.

Report of Reuters on October 1 in Tokyo: A quarterly Tankan survey report released by the Bank of Japan on Monday showed that the confidence of Japanese major manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year for that season in September, as raw material costs rose and a series of natural disasters affected production, putting pressure on enterprises.
This survey almost didn’t show that the escalating global trade frictions shook the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, risks of outbreak of an all-out trade war stuck the business prospects of enterprises, likely to threaten the business capital expenditure.
The active capital expenditure is a highlight of Japanese economy.
This survey raised questions about the view of the Bank of Japan on that robust economic expansion would help to accelerate inflation to the 2% target, although there were signs that enterprises were gradually shifting costs to the customers.
"With concerns raised by the global trade war, as exports slowed down and factory production weakened, the confidence of manufacturers tended to stagnate," said Takeshi Minami, the Principal Researcher of Norinchukin Research Institute Co., Ltd..
"Confident is still at a high level. And since corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline. "
The Tankan survey showed that the judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing declined from positive 21 for three months ago to positive 19 in September, worsening for the third consecutive quarter.
The median market forecast is positive 22.
The judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing declined from positive 24 researched in June to positive 22 in September, worsening for the first time for eight quarters.
The survey of Reuters was positive 22.
The survey showed that the judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing was expected to remain stable in December.
Investors were indifferent to the decline of the judgment index for the boom of Tankan enterprises. The Nikkei .N225 rose to a 27-year high spot on Monday as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export profit prospects of Japanese enterprises.
The capital expenditure was robust.
Although the confidence of enterprises declined, the latest Tankan highlighted the robustness of enterprise capital expenditure plans, benefiting from the renewed capacity and increased investment in robots and automation to cope with the labor shortage caused by the aging of population.
The Tankan survey of the Bank of Japan showed that the capital expenditure of large-scale enterprise plans would increase by 13.4% for the fiscal year ended in March 2019.
It was 13.6% for previous Tankan survey.
Takeshi Minami said that the capital expenditure of all enterprise plans for this fiscal year increased by 8.5%, close to the pace of Japan’s bubble era.
He said, "considering that small businesses raise their profit estimates from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditure, but that largely depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence. "
The Tankan survey showed that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs was enhanced. The output price index of large enterprises was positive 7, which was a 10-year high spot. It was an encouraging sign, reflecting that Japan had made progress in its efforts to combat deflation.
The index measuring the employment situation of large enterprises hit negative 23, which was the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Benefiting from the robust enterprise expenditure, Japanese economy rebounded from January-March shrink in the second quarter.
However, the escalation of trade frictions in summer and the disturbance of natural disasters on supply chains had casted a shadow over the prospects of Japanese economy which depended on exports.
In dollar terms, import and export of services increase by 16.4%.
The news release of the website of the Ministry of Commerce citing the head of the Department of Trade in Services and Commercial Services said that the total import and export volume of emerging services exceeded 1 trillion yuan from January to August, and the growth rate was faster than that of the whole.

Oil prices may usher in the "three consecutive rises", drivers can fill up the tank for National Day self-driving travel in advance.
China News Service, Beijing, September 30 (reporter Qiu Yu) - At 24 o’clock on September 30, the new round of refined oil price adjustment window will be opened simultaneously with the National Day holiday.
A number of institutions predict that oil prices will rise sharply, achieving a "three consecutive rises".
Car owners who plan self-driving can fill the car with oil before the price increases.
According to the data calculated by OilChem, the corresponding increase magnitude in domestic refined oil is expected to be around 190 yuan/ton; the increase predicted by Zhuochuang Information is 220 yuan/ton.
In September, oil prices have been raised twice: on September 3, gasoline was raised by 180 yuan / ton, diesel was raised by 170 yuan / ton; on September 17, gasoline was raised by 145 yuan / ton, diesel was raised by 145 yuan / ton.
Domestic oil prices link up with international oil prices. Since the current round of pricing, international oil prices have increased with fluctuation and Brent crude oil has broken through the $80 mark and continues to increase.
As of the closing on September 28, the US WTI crude oil futures closed up with $1.13 US, reported $73.25 / barrel.
Brent crude oil futures closed up with $1.0 , reported $82.72 / barrel.
"From the international situation, the US sanctions against Iran and other tensions are superimposed, and the overall trend of oil prices is strong. Subsequently, the OPEC Production Cut Conference explicitly refused to increase production, giving market confidence to believe that the oil prices will move up steadily. "
Zhuochuang Information refined oil product analyst Zang Wengang said.
In terms of retail sales, the prices of gasoline at No. 92 and No. 95 of Beijing CNPC and Sinopec gas stations are 7.66 yuan/liter and 8.15 yuan/liter respectively.
According to Li Yan, an analyst at OilChem, there is no big changes in the preferential sales promotion strategy for gas stations. At present, the preferential price of main stations such as Sinopec is 0.5-0.7 yuan/liter, while the preferential rate for private gas stations is 0.5-. 1.2 yuan/liter.
"This round of retail price is about to usher in ‘three consecutive rises’, which is equivalent to an increase of about 0.14-0.16 yuan. It is recommended that private car owners fill up with oil before the National Day holiday. " Li Yan said.

More than 6300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and enterprises, experts and scholars, and young students from all over the world attended the event.
Yves Le Gall, the chairman of International Astronautical Federation addressed at the opening ceremony that the global aerospace industry was no longer involving only a few countries and agencies. The number of participants this year was significantly increasing from last session, which suggested that more and more institutions and individuals were taking part in it.

Report of Reuters on November 5 in Beijing: According to a press release released on Sunday by the China Foreign Trade Center, the Canton Fair showed that the situation of China's foreign trade was still complex and serious, with expectation of 80.6% of enterprises exports in 2018 to be better than or maintain at the same level as last year.
However, in consideration of the rising costs of domestic raw materials, labor force and other comprehensive factors, as well as the external environment of the increasing impact of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors also believed that the export situation of next year was not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, the deputy secretary-general and spokesman of the Canton Fair, and the vice-director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of this Canton Fair had declined slightly compared with the same period of last year.
The number of buyers who attended this Canton Fair was 189,812 and they came from 215 countries and regions, with a decrease of 1.11% on year-on-year basis.
The amount of export transactions was 206.494 billion yuan ($29.86 billion), with a decrease of 1% on year-on-year basis.
From the perspective of the market, the transactions with Japan, the ten ASEAN countries, "the BRICS countries" and Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, while the transactions with traditional markets of the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
From the perspective of the industry, the transactions of transportation tools, machinery and equipment, building and decorative materials, electronic consumer goods, information products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0% and 15.1% respectively, while the transactions with textile clothing and household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and weathervane of China's foreign trade, the buyers’ participation situation and the export transaction data of this Canton Fair showed that China's foreign trade development would still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reform and the "six stability" policies and measures recently introduced by the state and local governments in succession, the new drivers for the development of China’s foreign trade was accelerating the accumulation, and the diversification of enterprises and markets had made new progress, all of which were the important foundation and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Taking all factors into consideration, it is expected that the imports and exports of China's foreign trade will maintain a steady growth throughout the year, with further improvement in quality and efficiency. " Xu Bing said.
The China’s General Administration of Customs published that priced in dollars, the exports in September increased by 14.5% on year-on-year basis, the imports increased by 14.3% on year-on-year basis, the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, and the export growth rate and trade surplus in September were the highest since February.
In despite of the escalating trade frictions between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still significantly exceeded expectation. Strong external demand, and the enterprises rushing to export before imposing tariffs in the United States and the depreciation of RMB exchange rate, might be the main supporting factors, and also showed the resilience of China's foreign trade to a certain extent. However, the impact of the Sino-US trade war on confidence and the industrial chain can not be neglected. Analysts believed that the challenges for China's foreign trade might emerge in the fourth quarter or next year.
Reuters surveys showed that the U.S. fund managers proposed to increase cash holdings and stood the cautious ground in September, since the United States and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs and there was no sign of dispute easing.
However, according to the suggestion of 12 fund managers who participated in this survey, the asset allocation in North America rose to the highest level since June 2017, while positions in Britain, the Eurozone and particularly emerging markets declined.
The average of global stock allocation accounted for 56.6% and the bonds accounted for 35.5%, which was basically consistent with the survey of last month.
The most obvious change was that the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, which was the highest proportion since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company said, "Some economic data have brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so that it's better to get prepared to enter when the market falls after a rise. "
However, the fund managers still preferred stocks in September, especially American stocks, even though the price of American stocks were considered to be on the high side.
Today, in Shanghai, the opening-up landmark of China, China International Import Expo (CIIE), the world's first large-scale state-level exhibition with the theme of import, has officially opened in much anticipation.
An exhibition is like a "window" which can let the world know a city and a country better.
Through the "window" of CIIE, people can see the "opening-up China" which moves towards a higher level; with the help of the "window" of CIIE, we welcome the world and China which is "restarting from reform and opening-up", to achieve mutual benefits and win-win results.
"For a country, opening-up is like coming out of the cocoon and becoming a butterfly. There will be pain, but there will be new life. "
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of Open Road reveals an important reason "why China can do it".
Looking back on the past 40 years of reform and opening-up, China dares to plunge into the vast sea of the world market. Although it has encountered whirlpool and storm, it always faces all risks and challenges with an open attitude, constantly releases its endogenous driving force and continuously improves its competitiveness.
So to speak, China has fully demonstrated the value and significance of opening-up with its solid achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, it is a major decision to hold an expo with the theme of import made by the Party Central Committee with the core of Comrade Xi Jinping with a view to promoting a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It is a major measure for China to actively open the market to the world and is also a practical action taken by China to support the economic globalization and trade liberalization, showing a strong and clear will that "China's opening door won't close, but would open wider and wider".
Exhibitors from all over the world are eager to enroll in the exhibition, and "it is difficult to apply for a stand", which is the greatest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a larger scope, a wider range of fields and at a deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroad.
Some countries have built trade protectionist walls and retreated into the unilateralism, which increases anxiety of the international society about the prospects for free trade and adds much uncertainty to a recovering world economy.
Under such era background, this grand gathering along the Huangpu River demonstrates China's guard to free trade and shows the world China's confidence and responsibility to open its markets and share its future.
It is fast to go alone but it is further to go in crowds.
By embracing the world with an open mind, China has not only vigorously promoted its own development, but also brought about tremendous "China opportunities" to other countries and regions.
In recent years, by advocating and promoting the joint development of the "One Belt and One Road", initiating and setting up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and establishing the Silk Road fund... China has provided a series of international public goods, a solid export market, development opportunities and jobs, allowing companies of various countries to get a ride on the "express train" and take "hitchhiking" of China's development.
CIIE is also this kind of public goods and a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have made their debut with high-quality products and services with distinctive features, taking a new step into the Chinese market.
Apart from companies of various countries, the real beneficiaries are domestic consumers.
By building the platform of "selecting the best and importing the best", we can provide multiple channels of high-quality supply for consumption upgrading and meet people's personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs.
As China's opening-up door opens wider and wider, the goods flow is smooth and materials are put to good use, thus the pace towards a better life will be more solid.
From a broader perspective, the significance of CIIE has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade. It has the future in mind, conveys the concepts of openness, inclusiveness, universal benefit, balance and win-win, and forms a consensus to jointly meet today's challenges.
Only when the world is doing well can China do well; when China is good, the world is better.
We expect CIIE to make the world wonderful and complete; we are looking forward to the bright future that an "opening-up China" moving to a higher level and the world build a community of human destiny.
Foreign media report that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Abstract] The content of the Agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and a temporary suspension of U.S. tariffs on the cars produced in Canada.
It is reported by foreign media that a Canadian source said in the evening of September 30 at local time that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It is revealed that the content of the Agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and a temporary suspension of U.S. tariffs on the cars produced in Canada.
On Day 27 of last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary principled agreement on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement while the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the deadline set by the American side of August 31 and extended the negotiation deadline to September 30.
Previously, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada would only sign a favorable agreement, and "the focus is on substance rather than timetables. We will continue to consult in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in line with the national interests of Canada. "
Over 90% of Brazilian female voters said that the presidential candidate did not consider women’s needs.
According to the Overseas Chinese News Network of South America, data released by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) recently showed that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not think that the presidential candidate considers the needs of women.
According to the report, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million. If women from all over Brazil are brought together to form a country, the country’s population will rank 13th in the world, more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of the women voters accounts for 52% of the total number of voters, and men account for 48%. Although the proportion of women among voters is very high, the proportion of women in the National Congress of Brazil is only 10%.
Among the 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women’s participation in politics ranks only 154th, higher than that of Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of power struggle, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in obtaining their reserved rights.
According to Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori, the existence of this phenomenon is because of the combined effects of ancient patriarchal society, racialism, and capitalism values.
"Politics should be civil rights, identity, access to public goods, and the formation of the same society by multiple social groups advocated by citizens. But the politics of Brazil belong to a monopoly of a certain group, and most of the population is not represented. "
A previous study by the Locomotiva also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that the politicians elected by the election can represent their rights, and 90% of Brazilian women disagree with the decisions made by politicians. 93% of women disagree with the current government policy.
"We need to reverse the problem of underrepresentation of women in National Congress, and Brazil’s political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there has been serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political field in Brazil. " Natalia Mori said.
Although there is the lack of women’s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey shows that 76% of women believe they can make a difference in democratic elections, and 72% of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to expose women to less prejudice.

Although Barclays is optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy by the end of this year, the bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to predict the longer term.
"Under the circumstance that is lack of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, current fiscal policy-driven growth will be unsustainable," Economist Barclays indicated in a research report.

ECNS, Qingdao, October 1 -- Affected by Typhoon Trami, the first race day of 2018 Qingdao "Mazarin" Cup powered by Extreme Sailing Series was postponed from September 30 to October 1, and the pre-game meeting was held before the race in Olympic Sailing Center in Qingdao. The captains of 12 hydrofoil catamaran teams from 6 countries and regions attended at the meeting.
Affected by Typhoon Trami, the strong winds constantly blew in the harbor basin and the maximum wind speed even reached 24 knots. The sailing signal was delayed by nearly 90 minutes from 1:00 pm on September 30. The wind speed was still not reduced, so the Race Director Anne Mallédant announced to cancel the race of the first day and postpone the race to the afternoon on October 1.
"The strong winds from the shore never seem to stop, and the state of the sea is so severe. "
Mallédant explained: "No one knows the time when the gust will blow to the racing boats as well as the scale of wind force.
Since the boat-sailing field is near the city, so far as it goes, the wisest choice is to cancel the race. "
The sailors still felt a little disappointed for everything was ready.
"The racing boats are ready, and we are in excellent condition. "
The helmsman of Qingdao Team Max Richardson said frankly: "But I know it is a right choice to change the race date. And I hope the wind will die down today, so that we can do some good. "
Micah Wilkinson, the "Hope Star" of New Zealand Team for 2020 Tokyo Olympiad, said: "Losing a day's time makes the race more interesting.
Because the race content will be increased today, and there will be only two days left for the race.
All of us will play hard. "
Though the sea wind blew violently, the helmsman of French ABM Team Pierre-Yves Durand told his warm memories with Qingdao at the pre-game meeting that he was accidentally injured in the Extreme Sailing Series 5 years ago, resulting in the muscular rupture, and fortunately, the local race medical team helped him deal with it so that he could stand here to take part in the race after 5 years.
It was learned that the Extreme Sailing Series started from 2007, and it was an ISAF game equivalent to the Volvo Ocean Race, the America's Cup and the World Match Racing Tour.
The hydrofoil catamaran of "FlyingPhantom" would be used in this race in Qingdao.
It is the 8th year of having this race in Qingdao, the "City of Sails". And it is the last race of this Series.
Although the turbulence in global financial markets continued, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year fell by 97% annually, and it was better than that in the previous quarter, since overseas stocks rose and foreign exchange losses obviously narrowed under the China-U.S. trade war.
According to the latest data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion from July to September 2018, significantly lower than HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on the legislative session that at the beginning of the China-U.S. trade war, the share index in Hong Kong and emerging markets ran counter to the U.S. share index. By the end of September and early October, after the U.S. share index peaked in succession, the market sentiment began to reverse, since investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the U.S. itself.
"It is good to have changes in the market sentiment. If the trade war only has unilateral effects, it doesn't help much for solving problems. "
He also pointed out that "if the trade war cannot be solved, the fluctuation of financial markets will continue to rise. "
In the third quarter of this year, the stock investment losses of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK$4.7 billion compared with the previous quarter, and the investment income of overseas stock increased by 17.2% to HK$12.8 billion; the foreign exchange losses was HK$16.2 billion and the bond yields was HK$9.7 billion, with a decrease of 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general rise of the US dollar for exchange of major currencies in this quarter and the rise of the US coupon rate to above 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund was mainly used for supporting Hong Kong dollars.
Hong Kong has implemented the linked exchange rate system for the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar since 1983.
As for the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the uncertainty of the economic and asset markets increased and downside risks increased, but the financial system Hong Kong was robust, so that good defence were made and the earthquake-resistant capacity was abundant.
"The international investment position is abundant in Hong Kong, with a net external asset value of US$1.4 trillion, which is 4 times GDP, higher than 2.5 times in Singapore and 0.6 times in Japan. It is enough to cope with the financial downturns or reversal. "
The current daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall and the interest margin with US dollars expanded. Chen Delin pointed out that the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar rose more than 400 basis points on September 21. The markets generally believed that it was mainly related to the rise of the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars. And then the Hong Kong dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 for exchange of the US dollar. Until recently, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall, and the interest margin with US dollars expanded, which might attract more hedging activities to sell the Hong Kong dollar and buy the US dollar, triggering the opportunity of the exchange guarantee of the weak side again to increase compared with that of the previous period.
However, he believed that as the interest-rate rise cycle of the Hong Kong Bank began and the Hong Kong dollar interest rates were normalizing, the situation that Hong Kong dollar interest rates were lower than US dollar interest rates would change in the future.
"The trend of Hong Kong dollar interest rates and US dollar interest rates will be more consistent. Everyone must be more careful to manage risks and prepared to cope with market fluctuations. "
Since the funds of the Hong Kong dollar was abundant, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars fell further. The three-month daily interest rates on private loan fell by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and the interest rate differential with the US dollar increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month daily interest rates on private loan hit the bottom within five months, and the interest rate differential with the US dollar increased from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot rate of Hong Kong dollars was close to 7.85 with exchange of $1 most of the time.
During that time, due to factors of partial share offer gained outflows from Hong Kong dollars after the completion of interest arbitrage activities and large-scale share offer activities, causing that the exchange guarantee for the weak side was triggered for the first time in April, and for many times in May and August.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought Hong Kong dollars and sold Hong Kong dollars at the level of 7.85 according to the linked exchange rate system, in order to maintain the stability of the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought around HK$52.1 billion under the mechanism of exchange guarantee of the weak side from May to August.
Does foreigners can benefit from the new Individual Income Tax Law?
On 30th, the relevant person in charge from Ministry of Finance and State Administration of Taxation answered the reporters that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
Some reporters asked that the newly revised Individual Income Tax Law will adjust the criterion for resident taxpayers of China’s Individual Income Tax Law from one year to 183 days.
"May I ask if there are any preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, in implementing this new law?"
The principals responded that the current effective Individual Income Tax Law’s enforcement regulations have special preferential provisions for taxation issues for foreigners. For individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for more than one year and less than five years and earn incomes from outside China, their part of the payment by domestic units or individuals is subject to individual income tax.
The principals said that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
The confinement center without "threshold": quality certification would promote the quality.
As the "two-child economic" develops and the maternal and child market thrives, various grades of confinement service centers appeared around China, from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to the 3rd and 4th tier cities.
The popular confinement service centers, which could satisfy the consumer's demands, charged from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan. However, they were in an awkward situation, because this kind of institution had no threshold at all, and there was still the There is still a blank zone in regulation.
Recently, the State Administration for Market Regulation carried out a series of activities of 2018 National "Quality Month". The reporter came to a five-star confinement center in Tianjin to explore the certification of maternal and child care services.
A common confinement center provided the services of newborn care, nutritious food, and postpartum reconstruction, etc.
The reporter found in this confinement center that the nurses would check the newborn breastfeeding each day, and the professional nursing workers would provide the newborns with the careful nursing services, such as bathing and touching.
In order to satisfy the new mother's demand, it would provide the wound care in the beginning of confinement, bodybuilding care in the middle and later periods of confinement, Chinese traditional cosmetic treatment and other nursing items to help the new mother restore her graceful figure.
A new mother there told the reporter that she had booked this confinement service center 8 months in advance.
The service items of confinement service center would directly impact the parturient's comfort and body recovery during the confinement. Some small confinement service centers could only provide some simple services during the confinement, but there were many problems and hidden troubles, including the irregular sterilization and sanitation, incidental cross infection, limited and unscientific diet, etc.
The responsible person of this confinement center said that they were the only one five-star confinement center in Tianjin, which had been certified as a Grade B service provider.
"Some customers didn't understand the meaning of the Grade B certification at first, but the fact forcing the enterprises to strictly implement the standardized process management through certification will benefit the customers. It is important for the long-term development of enterprises. " he said.
Pan Lifen, the deputy director of the Attestation Supervision Department of the State Administration for Market Regulation, said that the service certification was a new kind of certification system, which was based on the customers' perception and focused on the organizational quality management and satisfaction of service characteristics. It was an important part of the national quality infrastructure, and had a positive effects on increasing the proportion of quality services and enhancing China's international service competitiveness.
After more than 10 years of development since 2004, the service certification project in our country had gone through a process of developing from scratch. A series of influential service certification had appeared, including the financial service certification, mother and baby nursing service certification, after-sales service certification, electronic commerce service certification, and health care service certification.
According to the statistics of the State Administration for Market Regulation, there are more than 130 service certification institutions with over 2000 service certification staff and nearly 8000 valid authentication certificates at present in our country.
Pan Lifen said that it was necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually extend the coverage of service certification in the fields of health, education, sports, finance and electronic commerce, and boost the supply-side reform and quality enhancement in the service industry.
Report of Reuters on November 5 in Hong Kong: the property price in Hong Kong fell for two consecutive months after peaking. Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Monday that it needed time to observe whether the property market had entered downturns. If confirmed, it can be considered to successively ease the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures at an appropriate time.
Chen Delin also pointed out that if the property price fell, the first to be affected would be those who bought properties at the peak of the property market, but it was expected that there would be less opportunities to occur the situation like sharply falling property prices and the properties substantially sold by the citizens during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.
When leading multiple senior leaders of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to attend the briefing session of the legislative session, Chen Delin said that if the property market was determined to enter downturns, the ease of measures can be made in succession at an appropriate time.
"However, since data of a few weeks only can currently be seen, it's still too early to ease, and it needs more time to see whether the property market is entering downturns. "
Since October 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has successively launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to substantially tighten the mortgages of various properties, including reduction of the number of mortgages, and that the mortgage applicants have to pass rigorous stress tests, in order to improve the bank risk management and shock resistance.
As Hong Kong formally entered the interest-rate rise cycle, the house price index of private houses in Hong Kong peaked for two consecutive months in August and September and then fell, and the monthly decline in September even expanded to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year was still 10.2%.
According to the data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the household financial conditions for the ability of Hong Kong to withstand financial risks were measured to be healthy. In the second quarter this year, the percentage of households of self-occupation non-mortgage residence in Hong Kong was 66%, which was higher than the average of 60% in 2009-2011; the average loan-to-value ratio of the newly approved mortgage and the percentage of contribution and income of the newly approved mortgage was 47% and 34% respectively, with obvious improvement compared with 64% and 41% in 2009-2011.
However, Chen Delin said that high shock resistance didn’t mean the citizens who had bought properties wouldn’t be suffered damage of financial downturns, since the property valuation would fall, and those who bought properties at peak times would be the first to be affected.
Although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority tightened the lending of the bank to the mortgage borrowers, those who bought properties can also get a high-percentage mortgage loan by means of the mortgage insurance, the mortgage loan provided by the developer and so on.
Chen Delin said that currently together with the mortgage loan provided by the developer, the mortgage percentage of the borrower can reach 85-90%. If the property price fell by 10%, there would be negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property fell below the level of the total outstanding mortgage loan).
However, Ruan Guoheng, the vice president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority pointed out that the Authority estimated the total high-percentage mortgage loan provided by the developer to account for 2-2.5% of the total mortgage of the bank, with lower proportion.
At the peak time of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, with proportion of 22% in those who took mortgage.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative asset for seven consecutive quarters.

ECNS, Shenzhen, October 1 (reported by Zheng Xiaohong, Xu Dianwei & Liu Shumeng) -- It was the first day of the National Day "Golden Week" in the mainland on October 1. And it was also the last day of the National Day public holiday in Hong Kong. Many mainland residents used this holiday to travel and go shopping across the border, while many Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong after visiting Shenzhen. The passenger volume of Shenzhen ports was "full to bursting", and the ports in Luohu and Shenzhen Bay had newly opened 22 automated gateways. This would improve the clearance efficiency in ports and facilitate the passengers to be cleared by the customs effectively and rapidly.
According to the data provided by Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection, over 4290000 people and over 168000 vehicles had been transported across the boarder by 16:00 that afternoon. The ports had always been busy and orderly with a good order of entry and exit.
It was learned that there were an increasing number of passengers taking advantage of the National Day holiday to visit the countries in Europe and Southeast Asia to go shopping affected by many positive factors, such as there were more countries providing the visa-free policy for the Chinese citizens.
The passenger (car) flow peak in the exit direction in the ports in Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang, and Futian occurred in the morning of October 1. The passenger flow peak in Luohu port lasted from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, and the passenger (car) flow peak in Shenzhen Bay port lasted from 6:30 am to the noon at 13:00.
According to the introduction, in order to cope with passenger (car) flow peak across the boarder, Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection followed the unified deployment of the State Immigration Administration to start the service mode of passenger (car) flow peak period, arrange the policemen to work overtime to support those working in the front-line on duty, open enough passages for inspection and examination in advance, ensure that the queueing time of Chinese citizen's exit and entry would not exceed 30 minutes while taking into account of the foreigner's clearance efficiency; the order maintenance in the crowded was enhanced, and the customs clearance was ensured to be safe and orderly.

The passengers headed for Hong Kong via Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link must take their valid exit & entry documents, visas and endorsements. The high-speed rail ticket could be used as a proof of payment only, but not the exit and entry certificate. Anyone, who couldn't go to Hong Kong across the boarder due to the reasons such as the documents and procedures were not satisfiable, should follow the guide of the policeman on duty in the Frontier Inspection, and go to the designated site to wait for the staff of MTR corporation to guide them to go through the procedures of returning the mainland by train.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and stubborn disease involving multiple organs of the body. It used to be considered as an "incurable disease".
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatment are difficult, and there is lack of effective treatment, it is hard to cure once and for all.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatism and Immunity Center at Peking University People’s Hospital, together with their teams discovered the existence of human immune globulin can increase the molecular variation of systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility, and this kind of variation is involved in the regulation of immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors and member of Peking University People’s Hospital, the team of Li Zhanguo collected nearly 2,000 large samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus to make study. It was found that patients with immune globulin variations produced pathopoiesis cells and a wide variety of numerous autoantibodies. The incidence and severity of nephritis, arthritis, orrhomeningitis vasculitis and other inflammations are significantly increased.
Through various research methods such as immune cell tracing, animal testing, and sequencing, Liu Wanli team found that the immune molecule variation activates the immune signaling pathway and the pathogenic mechanism of promoting B cells secreting various autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the powerful combination between two teams gave full play to their respective advantages and achieved a close integration between basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation research, and the Li Zhanguo team has long been engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This research is one of the results of years of cooperation between the two teams. It is also the first time in the academic community to recognize that immune globulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which lays a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy. "
This is not shield mistakes, but acting by law.
Lawyers took an axe to the court?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and it also caused a great disturbance in the legal circle.
Fujian Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court subsequently fined the lawyers for 500 yuan and proposed in writing to the Quanzhou Lawyers Association to investigate and handle.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association issued a formal notice that the behaviors of the two lawyers did not involve violations of laws and regulations and were not punished according to law.
According to the multi-party reports, the handling of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is not a shortcomings protection or confrontation, but has been approved by the Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court.
An event that could have caused tension within the legal community was eventually resolved properly.
The reversal of the event stems from the more completed truth restoring: the axe carried by the lawyer involved is the same type and same model as the defendant’s weapon, but it is not put the first edge. It only serves as secondary evidence in the evidence-proven and cross-examination link, and there is no threatening acts or the subject intention of "endangering the court security".
Judging whether the behaviors of the lawyers involved is illegal or not, there are four very important details to be concerned. First, the local court has twice held the court and only showed a photo of the axe. From the perspective of defense, it is necessary to show the original axe. Second, the axe is purchased one hour before the court open. It is not that the lawyer is not willing to seek the judge’s consent, but it is not able to contact the judge objectively. Third, the axe has not been used in an excessive or improper manner. Fourth, the lawyers admitted the mistake in public and immediately apologized to the court.
Based on these plots, it can be seen that the lawyers who "took axe to appear in court" have nothing to do the devil things, but just to make defense.
After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association did not follow the societal discussion, but resisted the pressure and made a decision not to impose penalties.
And this decision can withstand the test of facts and laws.
As taking the axe as the controlled knife to the court without the permission of the court, it is easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
For the sake of safety and cautious, Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court’s previous fine punishment and judicial advice are also understandable.
In order to maintain the dignity of lawyers and prevent several courts from finding excuses to purposely make difficulties for lawyers, the Supreme Law promulgated the "Rules on Security Checks by Judicial Policemen of the People’s Courts" in 2014, establishing the principles that lawyers do not need to conduct personal security check in court.
Since the issuance of the Rule, lawyers have set examples, and there have been few incidents endangering the court security happened due to the omissions of security checks.
In such a very rare case happened in Quanzhou, as long as we communicate in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization in the lawyer profession, the Lawyers Association bears the dual mission of disciplining against law and safeguard the legitimate rights.
In the past, individual Lawyers Association organizations have been blamed for their emphasis on disciplinary action and their loss of safeguard.
The decision of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is worthy of praise both in terms of process and results, and it sets an example for more lawyers association to perform their duties correctly.
Which tax benefits will affect our money bag from October 1?
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (reported by Sang Tong) -- The New Individual Income Tax Law will be implemented from January 1, 2019. In order to have the broad masses of the people enjoy the benefits of tax reduction as soon as possible, the tax will firstly be deducted from taxpayers' actual job salaries based on the minimum threshold of 5000 yuan per month from October 1, 2019, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied.
With the implementation of new policy, which benefits will really affect the people's money bag?
The first benefit: the income tax will be reduced significantly in the job salaries.
The taxpayer receiving the job salaries after October 1 can have the basic deduction of fees deducted based on the threshold of 5000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied. Most of the taxpayers will enjoy different levels of tax reduction, especially the lower and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax reduction.
According to the tax reduction fact sheet of different income groups, for the people whose monthly income will be 8000 yuan, 10000 yuan, 20000 yuan, and 50000 yuan after deducting the "three insurances and one fund", the taxable amounts after the tax reform will be 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, and 9090 yuan respectively. Compared with the monthly threshold of 3500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8% respectively.
It is worth noting that due to holidays, the new basic deduction of fees and tax rate schedule can be applied to the salaries that should be paid by the units in October but have been paid at the end of September according to laws.
For this purpose, the withholding client software, which is uniformly promoted and used by the tax department, has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid during the statutory declaration period.
The second benefit: the gaps between grades of low tax rates will be obviously widened.
In addition to raising the threshold, the new tax rate schedule will be applied from October 1.
This time, seven grades of tax rates of job salaries are the same as before without any changes, but the gaps between grades of tax rates are obviously changed. The gaps between three grades of low tax rates in 3%, 10% and 20% are obviously widened, the gap of the grade of tax rate in 25% is slightly narrowed, but the gaps between three grades of high tax rates in 30%, 35% and 45% are the same as before.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the grades of tax rates for income from production and business operation, and the lower limit of the highest grade of tax rate in 35% has been increased from 0.1 million yuan to 0.5 million yuan.
This means that the individual businesses and personal exclusive investment enterprises will benefit from this tax reform.
"From the perspective of measurement and calculation of personal tax reduction for Shanghai taxpayers in the earlier stage, the broad masses of taxpayers will fully experience the benefits of the personal income tax reform, especially the lower and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax reduction. "
Lan Min, the head of Personal Income Tax Division of Shanghai Tax Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.
The third benefit: the tax service will become more convenient and optimized.
Shanghai tax departments have carried out a series of comprehensive activities of tax propaganda since the announcement of the new personal income tax law.
On the one hand, they provided the policy guidance on "one-to-one & point-to-point" for the important tax sources and important enterprises.
Pudong New Area Tax Bureau has visited Apple Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd., Red Star Macalline Group Corporation Ltd. and other large enterprises successively. These enterprises have a large number of employees and a large amount of works in withholding and remitting tax, so the tax department actively provided coaching and answered questions; Xuhui District Tax Bureau has visited some large labor service enterprises, including CIIC Financial Consulting Ltd. and CIIC Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Ltd. within the district. It collected their concerned problems, responded to their appeals, and resolved their difficulties in a timely way.
On the other hand, they implemented the "comprehensive, multidimensional and stereoscopic" tax policy promotion for the citizen taxpayers.
They used Shanhai Tax official website, WeChat official account, MicroBlog and other resources to post the hot topics and ensured that the policy announcements were in place.
At the same time, Shanghai Tax WeChat official account has put the 12366 Intelligent Consulting Platform since September 28. It would carry out the "targeted" integrated intelligent services of personal income tax reform via the "Human+Intelligence" tax service consultation.

The three countries have started the negotiation progress of it since 2017.
The result of the Election of Okinawa Governor, which was conducted ahead of schedule because the former governor Onaga Takeshi had died of illness, was announced on October 1 local time. Denny Tamaki, who opposed the plan of relocating the US military base in Japan, was elected successfully.
This election was voted on September 30. The final result showed that Tamaki had 396632 votes, which was the most votes made in the history of the Election of Okinawa Governor. He had over 80000 more votes than his major opponent Atsushi Sakima.
A total of 4 candidates participated in this election, and the voting rate was 63.24%, which was 0.89% lower than that of the Election of Okinawa Governor in 2014.
Tamaki told the media on October 1 that the result of election showed that the Okinawa people didn't want to waste the former governor Onaga Takeshi's efforts during his lifetime, and he would carry out Takeshi's behests to make continued efforts in opposing the plan of relocating the US military base and the closure of the Futenma base to the Japanese government and the American government.
The Futenma base is located in Ginowan in Okinawa Prefecture, and it has been criticized all the time. The Japanese government and the American government have agreed to relocate it to Henoko in Nago, but the Okinawa people strongly oppose this action and hope to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
For the relocation plan strongly opposed by Okinawa people and the request to cancel the permit for land reclamation along the coast of Henoko, Tamaki said that he didn't stand on the opposite and divisive ground against the central government at the beginning. He hoped that both sides could fully exchange views, show the intention to solve the problems through negotiation.
Japanese President Shinzo Abe also told the media in the morning of October 1 that he would seriously accept this result and make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
Yoshihide Suga, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, said in the press conference on October 1 that the government's policy of relocating the US base as soon as possible had not been changed at all.
And he also expressed his intention to talk with Tamaki.
Tamaki will officially take up his duties as the governor of Okinawa.
Since the mid-2000s, with China’s increasing needs for oilseeds, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota, has grown more and more soybeans in his field.
This transition reaches the peak this year. He has grown 1,600 acres of soybeans in the 5,000-acre land, reaching an unprecedented scale
However, in 2019, Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch production to the staple crops in the former U.S. agricultural region, such as corn and wheat.
The area of soybeans grown by American farmers exceeds that of corn this year, which is for the first time in 35 years.
The reason why the farmers plan to switch production to other crops is that American farmers face difficulties in selling soybeans in the context of the trade war launched by President Trump against China.
China usually purchases around 60% of soybeans exported from America, but because of the trade war, the purchases of American soybeans are nearly zero in recent months, leading to a 10-year low in soybean prices.
Thomas plans to grow more wheats next year and hopes to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that rely on Chinese demands.
Thomas said that the soybean price "brings us a heavy blow".
He said that the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per bushel without Chinese demands, while the price needed for covering costs was $8.50.
The area of soybeans grown by American farmers hits a high record and the harvest is expected to hit a high record.
At such a vulnerable time, they are hit by the trade war.
As Trump imposed tariffs on the goods imported from China, China imposes tariffs on the soybeans imported from America in July.
The United States Department of Agriculture will release the first estimated report of cultivated area next year, which is expected to include consideration of tariff effects.
This estimate is expected to confirm the expectations of non-governmental organizations that the cultivated area of soybeans will be reduced.
According to a report seen by Reuters, on October 19, Informa Economics predicted that the cultivated area of corns would increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) and the cultivated area of soybeans would decrease by 7% to 83 million acres in 2019.
Informa also predicted that the cultivated area of wheats in America would increase by 4%.
The cultivated area of soybeans increases to 89.6 million acres this year before retaliatory tariffs are implemented, which is about 15 million acres higher than that of 10 years ago.
The cultivated area of corns has increased by less than 5 million acres to 89.1 million acres since 2008. The cultivated area of wheats is 47.8 million acres this year, which is close to the lowest level in 100 years.
The total cultivated area of the president of Illinois Corn Growers Association Aron Carlson’s family is 3,600 acres. He uses nearly half of the land to grow soybeans, but he plans to make reduction in the future.
He said that the cultivated area of corns in the farm in North Illinois would increase by 20% at most; this state is the largest soybean cultivation state in America.
The yields per acre of soybeans are lower than that of corns, but less fertilizer is needed, which makes the cost of soybean cultivation relatively low as a whole.
If farmers switch production to corns, the cost may increase. But the fertilizer seller of Andersons Inc and other enterprises may benefit from it.
Pat Bowe, the CEO of Andersons said to Reuters that he predicted that switching production to corns would be beneficial to fertilizer use.
Bayer also predicts to benefit from farmers switching production to corns.

In recent years, as the changes of global economy and political power balance, some newly-developing markets and developing countries have emerged in groups, playing a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, and providing new development impetus for the multilateralism that has suffered from the headwinds.
Thinking in this dimension,building a big family but not making up small circles, adhering to discussion and collaboration but not winner-take-all and other the multilateralism ideas advocated by China follow the trend of the times, they are the inevitable choices to cope with global challenges and solve world problems, representing the common pursuit of the majority countries around the world.

As United Nations Secretary-General, Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the "trust deficit" faced by the world intensifies, when Populism and polarization trends are on the rise, it is the most urgent moment that the world needs multilateral cooperation.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands to turn consensus into actions, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the building of community with shared future for mankind.

The fifth "Month of vocalization for the disabled" comes; focus on the issue of sex education for disabled teenagers - China News
In recent years, the topic of sex education for Chinese teenagers has been widely discussed, but the challenge for sex education for disabled teenagers is still arduous.
Recently, the seminar on challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive sex education for the disabled was held in Beijing.
It is an major issue about how to carry out sex education for disabled children and young people in this seminar.
"The report of sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of Chinese disabled children and young people" released at the meeting reveals that the proportion of disabled children subjected to sexual harassment and abuse is higher than that of healthy children.
For disabled children and teenagers, what the society focuses on is the attention of "sexual protection".
This seminar aims at promoting the comprehensive sex education for disabled children and teenagers in China from three aspects of family support, school education and institution services, providing support to the disabled children and teenagers from the source, thus letting them enjoy the right of love as others do.
Experts believe that the Chinese public understanding of disabled groups has remained at a level that is not deep enough for a long time.
Being influenced by the traditional concept and other factors, the comprehensive sex education for the disabled, especially for the disabled children and teenagers in China, is not deep enough.
However, in recent years, with the support of the UNESCO and public-spirited people, the practice and implementation path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education for the disabled in China have made gratifying progress.
"The report" shows that the children and young people with visual impairment, hearing impairment, intellectual impairment and physical impairment have more difficulties in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationship than the ordinary people, but they have generally developed towards convenience and enrichment.
"The seminar on challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive sex education for the disabled" is held by the Shanghai Youren Public Welfare Foundation and supported by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the Beijing Representative Office of the International League for Disabled Persons (France) and the UNFPA Representative Office in China. Its purpose is to explore the practice and implementation path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education for the disabled in the context of grand strategy of healthy China, and promote the interested parties of policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations and parents’ representatives in the field of special education and integrated education to understand the international policy on comprehensive sexual education and the right to health of disabled children and young people; the practices, strategies, challenges and resources of sex education for disabled children and young people in China are widely exchanged, and the way of comprehensive sex education for disabled children and young people in the future is discussed and a blueprint is set up to form a support network.
Report of the Reuters on September 30 in Beijing - People's Bank Of China released its predetermined short-term net outflow of foreign currency assets on Sunday and showed as of the end of August this year, its short positions in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies remained zero for 12 consecutive months, and there were still no long position in that month.
Previous data from the People's Bank Of China showed that as of the end of August last year, the it had a total short position of $6.044 billion in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the short position in SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 4.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the foreign exchange forwards short position of the People's Bank Of China remained zero.
People's Bank Of China released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data showed that at the end of February 2016, its long positions in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies was US$2.438 billion and short positions was US$28.9 billion.
The data in September released at the end of October of the same year showed a net short position increase of $16.401 billion to $45.301 billion for the first time.
People's Bank Of China has previously said that the forward and futures short positions of foreign currencies vs local currencies mainly reflected the forward operations of foreign exchange carried out by the People's Bank Of China with commercial banks with the purpose of meeting the hedging needs of enterprises' foreign currency liabilities. It would continue to provide forward hedging products according to the principle of actual demand, and the forward operations of the People's Bank Of China would have minor impact on the scale of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, student Qiao, who was a junior in Zhengzhou, took the train to Hebi.
An elder uncle on the train bought a ticket without seat, but he took up her seat, and said: "you can take photos, whatever".
During the two hours of driving, the train conductor advised him for an hour, however it still had no results.
In the end, a male passenger in the same carriage could not stand up and pulled up the elder uncle.
From the public opinion, although the final result is mostly that the persons who forcibly occupy seats are condemned by the public, administratively punished by the public security department, and even included in the blacklist of integrity, the public still feels that it does not "vent their hates": Why can’t the persons who forcibly occupy seats be punished on the spot?
Why can’t stop immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but can only punish it afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of "the elder uncle who forcibly occupy seats", why only a male passenger pull him up because of "Road see injustice"?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with railway policemen, and there is generally no railway policemen for short-distance trains; even if there is railway policemen, the passengers are more concerned about the possible rogue reactions of the persons who forcibly occupy seats and do not take compulsory taking away measures.
Repeated seats forcibly occupied events have made people realize that it is necessary to let the persons who forcibly occupy seats be forced to take away or even be punished on the spot.
This requires that our railway policemen should dare to take powerful measures in a timely manner. Trains that do not have policemen should make deployment as soon as possible to preserve and prevent illegal activities in a timely manner.
It is the first day of the National Day holiday in October 1. There is a surge in the vehicles heading for Mao County and Songpan County via Beichuan Qiang Minority Autonomous County in Sichuan.
Beichuan Traffic Police received a call for help at about 13:00 saying that a family member had a traffic accident in Songpan and was badly in need of being sent to Mianyang for treatment due to the limited local medical conditions.
However, the Huanhu Road of Tangjiashan quake lake in Beichuan was under one-way traffic control, so the caller hoped the traffic police would permit the 120 emergency ambulance to pass though the road.
After getting the call for help, the policeman on duty quickly reported this to the traffic police group. After understanding the general situation, the group leader Huang Xuemin immediately arranged the policemen on duty at the controlled site to contact with the help seeker and asked them to do the escort job well.
"There were more than 1000 vehicles having entered the controlled road segment at that time. After contacting with the 120 emergency ambulance, we estimated that it would arrive at Beichuan at about 15:00, so we implemented the arrangement and deployment immediately. "
The leader of Yuli Squadron of Beichuan Traffic Police Da Wei introduced that the emergency ambulance needed to bypass the Huanhu Road of Tangjiashan quake lake, and the road was steep and narrow. In order to prevent the vehicles in the road segment from running side by side, the traffic police implemented the subsection control of vehicles in the beginning, the middle and the end of the road an hour in advance and reminded all drivers passing through it to make a way for the emergency ambulance.
Later, the policemen of Leigu Squadron also stopped the vehicles entering the controlled road segment temporarily, and asked the vehicles to form a line to make a way for the incoming 120 emergency ambulance.
An emergency ambulance with a "Chuan U" license plate was driving into Beichuan at about 15:00, and Beichuan Traffic Police sent a police car to clear the way and escort the emergency ambulance into the controlled road segment by driving against the traffic.
It was learned that some places on Huanhu Road only permitted one vehicle passing through, and the police implemented the temporary control at these places so that the 120 emergency ambulance could successfully pass through.
It was impossible to give way in a road segment in Shilibei Village in Daxuanping Town, so the traffic police got in touch with the village party branch and village committee in advance to use the village road for bypassing and stop the social vehicles from entering.
"It only took 40 minutes from Beichuan Traffic Police met the 120 emergency ambulance to drive into the normal road of the 302 provincial highway. "
Da Wei explained that the overall passing time needed to be 4 hours under normal circumstances.
"This arrangement has successfully saved precious treatment time for the patient. "
It was learned that the critically ill patient was timely sent to Mianyang for treatment at 17:20.

It was reported that Raab made this request to Simon Coveney, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Trade Minister of Ireland, at a private meeting in London last Tuesday.

Two suspected pickpockets were caught when they were picking pockets on No. 20 bus from Yongding Gate Station to Zhushikou Station at 8:05 yesterday morning.
These two male pickpockets cut the passenger's coat pocket, and stole 800 yuan cash from it. However, they were caught red-handed by the policemen, who had already waited nearby.
This is the first pickpocket case cracked by Beijing police during the National Day holiday.
The anti-pickpocket investigators of Beijing Police Mobile Investigation Corps arrived at the designated position at about 5:00 yesterday morning.
According to the previous experience, the places with massive human traffic, including the public transit hubs, bus and subway lines, and even the crowd watching the flag-raising ceremony in Tiananmen Square, are the key areas in their work.
In the crowd, the plainclothes policemen were calmly observing the people passing by.
The investigators, who were waiting at the bus station, found two suspicious man following a man to get on No. 20 bus from Yongding Gate Station at about 7:00.
On the bus, the two men standing on the left and right of the male passenger, and one of them tried to provide cover for the other.
But they didn't know that the plainclothes policemen standing by were paying close attention to their every movement.
"Catch the thief with the stolen goods". It was very critical for the plainclothes policemen to choose the timing of catching the thief. While waiting for the men to steal, the policemen had to keep their eyes on them, who were preparing for the pickpocket. As soon as they succeeded in pickpocket, the investigators caught them at one stroke.
The reporter of Beijing Morning Post learned that the policemen ferreted out 800 yuan cash from the suspected pickpockets.
"They took the money from the passenger's coat pocket. "
The policeman pointed to a broken coat pocket and said: "They cut it here, and stole 800 yuan cash from a Beijing tourist. When we caught them, they had just put the money into their pocket. "
The reporter learned that the plainclothes policemen had followed the suspected pickpockets for an hour in order to catch them. Finally, they caught them at one stroke when they were committing a crime.
Currently, the two criminal suspects were under the police's examination.
The plainclothes policeman told the reporter that it was easy for the policeman to recognize the suspects in the crowd.
"You will find out that the thieves' eyes and expressions were different from the ordinary passengers' when you have caught a number of thieves. In addition to staring at other people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to get into the crowd instead of avoiding the crowd. "
The policeman also told the reporter that the suspects were often purposeless while waiting for the bus. They liked to wander at the bus station and would follow the target to get on a bus.
"These are the voices of experience. If you have worked as a plainclothes policeman for a long time enough, you will know it quite sensibly. "
Furthermore, the policeman also reminded: "It is the most convenient to put things in the coat pocket, but it will be the easiest to be stolen. "
Mind your own property when you are traveling outside and taking a bus to avoid being stolen.

For activating rural consumption, it is necessary to rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of gain in farmers’ consumption.
According to data, the consumption potentiality of rural residents has been continuously released. In the first half of this year, the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5%, and the growth rate is 1.3 percentage points higher than that of towns.
During the visit to a poor village in a western county, there is only one convenience store in the whole village. Stepping into the store, some items are the brands we familiar with, however there are lots of fake good, such as "金龙鱼" is labeled as "金龙油" and "旺仔" labeled as "旺奶".
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed. Some rural fake and inferior products imitate famous brands, they have similar names and packages to mix the false with the genuine, which is really hard to prevent.
A consumer survey report released by a city in the west shows that rural shopping malls and supermarkets have a serious problem of fake products, and 66% of users have bought fakes in supermarkets in villages and towns offline, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments claim to rectify the rural markets every year, while, why the phenomena of fake products still occur repeatedly?
Different from the urban markets, farmers’ awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, and many villages are in remote locations within the blind areas of inspection force can’t reach, so that the fake and inferior goods have a breeding ground.
One product has more than one regulatory departments, some are responsible for price, some are for production, and others are for markets, so the functions are overlapped. Strong measures against fake and inferior products have been taken every year, however the central management can only last for a period of time. On one hand, the fakes escape the crack down trend and slowly emerged, on the other hand, the previous fakes just have been dealt and the new fake came out.
Some unscrupulous traders have initiated the idea of "going to the mountainous areas and the countryside" and some rural areas become the "waste elimination markets", both of these problems are because of long-term supervision mechanism, difficulties in purifying rural markets, low illegal cost and higher profit.
From food and clothing to well-off, the majority of farmers are moving towards development type consumption.
A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Some Opinions concerning Stimulating the Consumption Mechanism to Further Encourage the Consumption Potential of Residents", which proposed to promote the level upgrading of the consumption of rural residents. The purpose is to make the majority of farmers to "have ability to consume", "have willing to consume" and "dare to consume" to let the rural consumption really flourish.
On the one hand, we must deepen reforms, eliminate drawbacks of market management policies coming from multiple departments and regulate by more than one departments. According to local conditions, improve the food safety, product quality supervision network, and constantly reduce the space for rural fake products manufacturing and selling.
On the other hand, it is necessary to intensify law enforcement and open up the supervision of each department, and never allow the fake and inferior commodities to breed in the countryside.
It is the protection for farmers to severely punish the behavior of entrapping farmers. No matter how concealed the counterfeiters hide, it should not be the reason for the breeding of the fake and inferior commodities. Relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, and the grassroots supervisory powers should go down. If there is a problem in any part, it is necessary to investigate the responsibility and let the counterfeiters and selling persons have nowhere to hide.
Strictly control the market access, implement strict qualification examinations for production operators. Keep the market circulation, let the products have clear sources and outlet markets. Think of ways from the source and the roots, let the legal dealers operate with peace of mind, and let the farmers buy with confidence.
Activate rural consumption, guide the demand for healthy consumption.
As consumption upgrading, many farmers not only pursue of well fed and eat well, but also go after for high quality life with culture and healthy. Thus, rural markets are not equal to "low quality" and "low price".
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, connect the urban and rural two-way linkage sales channels, promote the combination of offline industry development platform and online e-commerce trading platform, support the new forms and new modes of consumption to expand into the rural market; promote qualified villages and towns to combine trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, and product processing dynamically; improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities resources, and effectively reduce rural circulation costs.
Create a clear and reassuring market environment for the rural areas, so that farmers can afford to buy, so that the rural consumption can become more and more prosperous and the farmers’ senses of gain and happiness can be enhanced.
Our country will reduce the MFN tariff rate for some goods from November 1, and the general tariff level will be reduced to 7.5%.
According to the decision of the 26th executive meeting of the State Council, the Tariff Commission of the State Council announced on September 30 that the MFN tariff rate for some goods would be reduced from November 1, 2018.
According to the "Tariff Commission of the State Council's Announcement on Reducing the Import Tariff for Some Goods", the MFN tariff rate for some goods, including the industrial goods, would be reduced from November 1, 2018 in order to adapt to the industrial upgrading, reduce the enterprise costs, and satisfy people's demands of multilevel consumption.
There were 1585 taxable items in total for the tax reduction goods, which accounted for about 19% of total taxable items in our country. The average tax rate was reduced from 10.5% to 7.8% by an average of 26%.
This tax reduction mainly involved the textiles; stones, ceramics, glass products; some steel and base metal products; electromechanical devices and parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, electric transmission and transformation equipment, electrical appliances, instruments and apparatus, etc.; resource goods and primary processed goods, such as non-metal ores, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, gemstone and jade, etc.
Meanwhile, with the reduction of general tariff level, especially the import tariff reduction of medicine and consumer goods, the taxable items and tax rate for import tax on imported goods would be reduced accordingly.
In order to implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, our country had implemented the zero tariff on most imported drugs since May 1 this year, had reduced the import tariff for automobiles and parts and some consumer goods since July 1, and had implemented the third step of tax reduction for products in the extended scope of Information Technology Agreement.
The reporter learned from the Tariff Commission of the State Council that the general tariff level in our country was reduced from 9.8% of the previous year to 7.5%, by an average of 23% after several continuous independent adjustments.
Proper tariff reduction would be beneficial to accelerating the balanced development of foreign trade, promoting the higher-level opening to the outside world, overall planning and using the international and domestic resources, and boosting the domestic supply-side structural reform.
The relevant responsible person of the Commission said that this year was the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up. Taking the initiative to reduce the general tariff level was the practical action of implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia, and our country's important measure of further opening up and actively expanding imports based on our demand for high-quality development. These action and measure showed that China would unswervingly pursue the mutually beneficial opening-up strategy, strengthen the motive of self-development, and deliver benefits to the world through its development.
On September 29th, the regional public brand launch event for the "Huanxiangren" agricultural products of Huan County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.
Red Army millet, black bean, mountain kids madrigal black goat, hardcover buckwheat tea, paper-cutting shadow puppets book, handmade slippers... All pieces of beautifully packaged agricultural products is neatly placed on the stand, they have a common brand name called "Huangxiangren".
"Create a regional brand of "Huanxiangren" has effectively solved the development bottleneck of agricultural products in the Huan County, which is ‘more but not centralized, small and weak’, and it has become a powerful carrier for poverty alleviation." On September 29th, the regional public brand launch event for the "Huanxiangren" agricultural products hosted by Huan County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.
Huan County is located at the junction of the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia. It is known as the "National Grain Production Advanced County", "China’s Minor Grain Crops Township" and "China’s Shadow Puppets Township". It has a long history and rich resources.
Local snacks such as lamb meat, yellow millet wine, buckwheat noodles, and oat noodles are the flavors that people often think of when they are away from their hometown.
As the level of urbanization in China continues to increase, the urban population has increased rapidly, and a large number of rural young people have left their hometowns to start urban life.
Yang Qiaojia, an expert on agricultural brand research in China, said: "Currently, urban life is fast-paced and stressful. More and more people are beginning to miss their rural life when they were young. However, ‘the place that cannot go back is the hometown, and the most beautiful memory is from the country’, the brand design of ‘Huanxiangren’ is named after the provincialism and homesickness of the wandering people of Huanhuan County. "
The climate conditions in Huan County are special, the sunshine time is long, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the conditions for planting special minor grain crops are richly endowed by nature.
There are more than 20 kinds of minor grain crops in the county. It is the hometown of China’s minor grain crops, and its output ranks first in Gansu, and its quality is front ranked in the country.
Wang Xiaoli is a Huan County girl who went to school in Tianjin. She participated in the promotion meeting as a volunteer. She said: "The people in my hometown are the most dear people, and the taste of the hometown is the most beautiful. The brand of ‘Huanxiangren’ has evoked too many homesickness and memories. What I have never forgotten is the food at childhood. I hope that the brand of ‘Huanxiangren’ will go further and further and become bigger and bigger. "
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher at the Academy for National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, said that through the detection of more than 900 sets of indicators, the detection data of agricultural products such as buckwheat, tartary buckwheat and black beans in Huanxian County are outstanding, and many physiological activators in miscellaneous grains are high. "Huanxiangren" has the inherent advantage of seizing the domestic high-end miscellaneous grains market.
Chai Chun, secretary of the County Committee of the Huan County, said that through the publish of the "Huanxiangren" brand, it can further improve the quality, standardization and scale of innovation and development of quality agricultural products in Huan County, which is conducive to shaping the good overall image of agricultural products in Huan County and rapidly increasing its popularity, competitiveness and added value.
The gross domestic product (GDP) of Canada grew by 0.2% in July compared with the previous month, with a higher-than-expected growing rate, raising market expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it does, it will be the fifth time in a bit more than a year that the bank raises interest rates.
The analysts of Reuters who made an interview previously forecasted a 0.1% increase.
The Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries had achieved growth.

The Bank of Canada will announce its next interest rate decision on October 24.
The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017 as the Canadian economy has strengthened and the unemployment rate is close to record lows.
Stephen Brown, the senior Canadian economist at Capital Economics, said that the country's third-quarter GDP was expected to grow at an annualized rate of around 2%.
"This will be 1.5% higher than the expectation of the Bank of Canada, which will be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a report.
Overnight index swaps show that the market forecasts for probability of risings of interest rate of the Bank of Canada in October rise from 76.46% to 78.27%.

Report on November 5 of China News: the website of the Chinese embassy in Mongolia reported on November 5 that Chinese citizens Guo Yuqin and Mao Runxin had been missing when traveling in Mongolia, .
It was understood that these two people were members of the Blue Sky Rescue team. On October 19, they contacted their relatives and friends in China and said they would immediately explore the mountains near the Khovsgol Lake. They shared their location via WeChat and then went missing. It was suspected that they had headed for the no man's land.
The Chinese embassy in Mongolia always paid high attention to the protection of the lawful rights and interests and safety of Chinese citizens in Mongolia, as well as the consular protection and assistance.
After being informed of the information about the two tourists going missing, the embassy immediately activated the contingency plan for consular protection, strived to seize the prime time for rescue and spared no efforts to work.
The embassy maintained close communication with the two tourists' families, assisted them in immediately reporting the case to the Mongolian police, and provided them with a list of interpreters for their choice.
The embassy made an appointment with the heads of the Mongolian Foreign Relations Department, the General Bureau of Police and the General Bureau of Emergency at first time to report relevant information. The embassy requested the Mongolian side to carry out the search and rescue operation as soon as possible and maintained close communication with the Mongolian side during the search and rescue process to ensure to keep up the latest progress.

The General Bureau of Police and the General Bureau of Emergency of Mongolia instructed the police and emergendy department of Hovsgol province to spare no efforts to search and rescue the missing persons.
Since Khovsgol Lake was located at the border of north of Mongolia and Russia, its location was in remote, and it was a vast territory with a sparse population of which transportation and communication was extremely inconvenient. Meanwhile, Mongolia has currently entered the winter, and the temperature was as low as around -20 degrees. The local police and emergency department overcame great difficulties, almost to mobilize all forces and stimulate the local herdsmen to carry out the carpet search and rescue operation around the wide range of the position where two people lost for days on end through the ways of horse riding, walking, and visiting the herdsmen.
Meanwhile, in view of special conditions in the pastoral areas, the Mongolia side has been circularly publishing the notice of missing persons through the radio for days.
Relevant staff of Chinese Blue Sky Rescue team have also come to Mongolia to actively participate in the rescue work together with the Mongolian side.
The safety of the two missing persons has always affected our hearts.
To date, the two people have been lost for more than 10 days. The embassy successively received some clues, but still cannot find them. The search and rescue operation was still under way.
The embassy would always follow the principle of "people first", sustain attention to this matter, push the Mongolian side to continue the all-out search and rescue operation and provide maximum assistance to the two persons' families.
The embassy appeals to the compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia to contact the Chinese embassy in Mongolia at first time for any relevant clues.
